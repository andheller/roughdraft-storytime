# A Cat Is Not a Friend

I have to tell you about my week, but first you need to understand about the rules, because the rules are important. The rules are the whole point. If you don't understand the rules, you won't understand why none of this was my fault.

Mom put the rules on the refrigerator on Monday morning, before she left for her new important job meetings. She used the magnet from the dentist, the one shaped like a tooth. I don't like that magnet. The tooth is smiling, and teeth don't smile. Teeth are just there, doing their job, not being happy about it.

The rules said:

1. Snack is on the counter. One snack each.
2. Homework before screens.
3. Stay inside. Backyard is okay if weather is nice.
4. Call Mrs. Henderson if there's a real emergency.
5. Take care of each other.

I copied these into my Documentation Notebook, with the date and time. Mom saw me doing it and made the face that means she's trying not to say something. Then she said it anyway.

"Frankie, you don't have to write everything down."

"Yes I do," I said.

"It's just a list. For one week. While I'm at training."

"Evidence is important," I told her. This is something I learned from the courtroom show she watches after we go to bed, the one with the lawyer who points at people and says *I have DOCUMENTATION*. That lawyer never gets in trouble. I plan to also never get in trouble.

Mom kissed the top of my head and said, "Take care of your brother," which was already Rule 5 so I don't know why she said it twice. Then she added, "Mrs. Henderson will check in on you at lunch and after school. I'll call at noon. If you need ANYTHING, she's right next door."

"I know," I said.

"And I'll be home by six every night. It's just the days you're on your own."

"I KNOW," I said again, because she was acting like I hadn't been listening, which I had, very carefully, with documentation.

Then she left.

Bean was watching me write. Bean is five, which means he can read some words but not all words, and the words he can't read he just guesses, and his guesses are always wrong but very confident.

"What's that say?" he asked, pointing at the list.

"The rules."

"What's a SNACK," he said, but he said it like the word was suspicious.

"You know what a snack is, Bean."

"No, what's A snack. ONE snack." He held up one finger in case I didn't know what one meant. "What is ONE snack?"

This was actually a good question. I looked at the counter where Mom had put out: a bag of pretzels, a box of granola bars, some cheese sticks, a bag of apple slices, and the crackers that are shaped like fish but don't taste like fish, which is lying.

"I think," I said slowly, "that a snack is one of these things. One bag of pretzels is one snack."

"One fish?"

"No, one BAG of fish. The bag is the snack."

"What if the bag has a lot of fish?"

"It's still one snack. The bag holds them together."

Bean thought about this. I could see him thinking. Bean thinking is dangerous, like a train made of questions that's about to crash into something.

"Frankie," he said. "What if I open the bag. And take one fish. Is that a snack?"

"That's... part of a snack."

"What if I open ALL the bags. And take one thing from EACH bag."

"That would be—" I stopped. That would be one pretzel, one granola bar, one cheese stick, one apple slice, and one fish cracker. None of those were a whole snack. But all together they were MORE than a snack. But each one separately was LESS than a snack. So was it one snack or five snacks or no snacks?

"I'll think about it," I said, which is what Mom says when she doesn't know the answer but doesn't want to admit it.

The cat showed up at 3:47 PM.

I know the exact time because I wrote it down. The cat was sitting on the back porch like she'd been waiting for us specifically, like we were late for an appointment she had scheduled. She was orange, the color of those cheese crackers that get dust on your fingers, and she had eyes that were green and yellow at the same time, which shouldn't be allowed.

"KITTY," Bean said, in the voice he uses for things he wants to touch immediately.

"We can't touch it," I said. "We don't know where it's been."

"It's been HERE," Bean said, pointing at the porch. "Right there. I can see it."

This was technically true, which is the most annoying kind of true.

The cat meowed. It was a very specific meow, the kind of meow that means *I am hungry and you are going to fix that*. The cat also looked hungry. She was thin, except for her belly, which was round like she'd swallowed a softball.

"That cat eats too much," I said.

"That cat eats NOT ENOUGH," Bean said. "She's STARVING, Frankie. Her tummy is empty. That's why it looks so big. It's full of empty."

That's not how stomachs work, but I didn't say that, because Bean was already opening the back door.

"BEAN. Rule 3. Stay inside."

Bean stopped. He looked at the cat. The cat looked at him. They had a whole conversation with their eyes, and I wasn't invited.

"Frankie," Bean said, very slowly, like he was explaining something to someone who wasn't as smart as him. "If the cat comes INSIDE, then I can play with the cat AND stay inside. That's doing the rule BETTER."

"That's not—" I started, but I couldn't finish, because it actually made sense. In a Bean way. If he was inside, with a cat, he was still inside. The rule said stay inside. It didn't say *stay inside WITHOUT a cat*.

"Also," Bean added, "Rule 5 says take care of each other. The cat is each other."

"The cat is not each other. Each other means you and me."

"The cat is HERE. The cat is WITH US. The cat is EACH."

The cat walked inside like she owned the place. She walked right past both of us, went straight to Bean's room, and climbed into his closet. She pawed at his pile of stuffed animals, moving them around, rearranging them into a shape I didn't understand.

"She's making a nest," Bean said, delighted.

"She's being weird," I said.

"Weird is just a word for things you don't understand yet," Bean said, which was DEFINITELY something he heard on a TV show, but I didn't know which one.

I looked out the window while Bean watched the cat be weird. Mrs. Henderson was coming home from somewhere, carrying way too many grocery bags and looking tired. Mrs. Henderson always looks a little tired, but today she looked tired AND annoyed, like someone had given her a problem she didn't ask for. She was also carrying a big bag of cat food, which was weird because Mrs. Henderson doesn't have a cat. She'd mentioned something last week about her sister trying to give her kittens, and how she absolutely did NOT want kittens, and how her sister never listens. I guess her sister won.

I decided not to bother her unless it was a real emergency, which a cat definitely wasn't.

The cat stayed.

That's not exactly true. The cat stayed because Bean fed her, and Bean fed her because I didn't stop him, and I didn't stop him because... okay, here's the thing. The rules said ONE SNACK EACH. Each means every person. The cat is not a person. The cat is a cat. So when Bean gave the cat some cheese sticks, those weren't OUR snacks. Those were CAT snacks. Different category.

I wrote this down in my Documentation Notebook: *3:58 PM - Cat given snacks from counter. Snacks were cat snacks, not people snacks. Cat is not a person. Rules do not apply to non-persons.*

This was good logic. This was LAWYER logic.

The problem was, the cat really liked snacks. And Bean really liked giving the cat snacks. And I went to the bathroom for TWO MINUTES, and when I came back, the cat was inside the snack drawer—THE ACTUAL DRAWER—and Bean was watching her like she was performing a magic trick.

"She opened it HERSELF," Bean said, like this was impressive and not terrifying.

The cat had eaten: all the granola bars (wrappers included, I think?), most of the cheese sticks, and an entire bag of apple slices (bag not included, thank goodness). The fish crackers were scattered across the kitchen floor like a crime scene.

"Bean," I said. "How long was I gone."

"One bathroom," he said, which is not a unit of time.

I looked at the cat. The cat looked at me. Her softball belly looked even softballer.

"I didn't give her those snacks," I said, mostly to myself. "She TOOK those snacks. Taking and giving are different verbs. I didn't break any rules. The CAT broke rules, and cats can't break rules, because rules are for people, so really NO rules were broken."

I wrote this down too. It's important to document your reasoning.

When Mom came home, she looked almost as tired as Mrs. Henderson. She asked how it went, and Bean said, "We have a cat now, she lives in my closet, her name is Scoops."

"Scoops?" Mom said, not really listening. She was looking at her phone and taking off her shoes at the same time, which she always says we're not allowed to do.

"Because she SCOOPS up food," Bean explained. "Like a digger. Diggers scoop."

"That's nice, honey," Mom said.

Bean looked at me. I looked at Bean. Mom had said *that's nice*, which is basically the same as *yes*, which is basically the same as *permission*.

"Told you," Bean whispered.

I didn't say anything. I was thinking about the snack drawer, which was empty now, which Mom would definitely notice tomorrow.

But that was tomorrow's problem.

Tonight's problem was making sure Scoops stayed in Bean's closet and didn't eat anything else, which she didn't, because she was too full to move, which was fine, probably.

When Mom asked how it went, I said fine, and that was true. The snack drawer situation was the cat's fault, and cats don't count.
