# Responsible People Ask For Help

Thursday was the day I learned that being scared and being responsible are not opposites. Sometimes they're the same thing.

It started at 3 AM.

I know it was 3 AM because I was already awake, lying in bed and thinking about all the things that could go wrong with a pregnant cat, when I heard the sound. It was a yowl—not a normal cat sound, but something deeper and stranger, like Scoops was trying to say something important but didn't have the words.

I got up and went to Bean's room. Bean was still asleep, because Bean can sleep through anything. Once he slept through a fire alarm test that lasted eleven minutes. He just rolled over and dreamed about diggers.

Scoops was in her closet nest, but she was lying differently than before. She was stretched out on her side with her paws extended, and her breathing was fast. Her belly looked even bigger, if that was possible—not round anymore but lumpy, like there were things moving around inside it.

"Scoops?" I whispered.

She looked at me. Just looked. And in that look was something I hadn't seen before: she was scared too.

I didn't know what to do. I'd never had a pet. The closest thing was the class hamster in second grade, and Mr. Whiskers had been very healthy and very boring and had never done anything except run on his wheel and eat pellets. He definitely never had babies in anyone's closet.

I went back to bed, but I didn't sleep. I just lay there, listening for more yowling, trying to remember if Mom had said anything about what to do if your secret pregnant cat started acting strange.

She hadn't. Because Mom didn't know about the secret pregnant cat. Because I hadn't told her.

In the morning, things were worse.

Scoops wouldn't eat. I put a bowl of food right next to her nest, and she just sniffed it and turned away. She was drinking water, a lot of water, but she wouldn't touch the food. Her eyes were half-closed and she kept making a low humming sound, like a machine that wasn't working right.

"Is she broken?" Bean asked, standing in the doorway of his closet.

"Cats don't break."

"She looks broken. She looks like when the TV gets stuck and we have to turn it off and on again."

"You can't turn a cat off and on again."

"Why not?"

"Because that's not how cats work, Bean."

But I understood what he meant. Something was wrong with Scoops, and I didn't know how to fix it.

I thought about Rule 4. *Call Mrs. Henderson if there's a real emergency.*

Was this a real emergency? Scoops wasn't dying. Probably. I didn't actually know what dying looked like in cats. Maybe this WAS dying. Maybe pregnant cats always acted like this before they died. Maybe I was watching a cat die and I didn't even know it.

The thought made my stomach hurt.

But calling Mrs. Henderson meant telling her that I still had the cat. That I'd had the cat all week. That I knew she was pregnant now and I hadn't done anything about it. That I'd been lying, sort of, about the whole situation.

I went back through the rules in my head:

Rule 1: No friends over without asking. ✓ (The cat is not a friend.)
Rule 2: Bean must stay inside until Mom gets home. ✓ (Bean has been inside.)
Rule 3: Snacks only from the approved snack drawer. ✓ (I replaced the snacks.)
Rule 4: Call Mrs. Henderson if there's a real emergency. ??? (Is this an emergency?)
Rule 5: Take care of each other. ✓ (I've been taking care of Bean.)

I had followed all the rules. Every single one. I had documentation to prove it.

So why did I feel like I had done something wrong?

I sat on Bean's bed, looking at Scoops, and I realized something. The rules weren't really about the rules. The rules were about making good choices. About being responsible. About thinking ahead and not doing stupid things that caused problems.

And I had done a stupid thing that caused problems. I had kept a pregnant cat in a closet for a week and pretended everything was fine.

The rules said I was okay. But the rules were wrong. Or I was using them wrong. Or something.

I picked up the phone and called Mrs. Henderson.

"Hello?" She sounded tired. She always sounds tired. But this time I understood why.

"Mrs. Henderson, it's Frankie. I need help."

There was a pause. "What kind of help?"

"The cat. Scoops. She's acting strange. She won't eat and she's making noises and she looks... she looks scared. And I don't know what to do. And I know I should have told you sooner. And I know I should have done a lot of things differently. But right now I just need someone who knows about cats because I don't know about cats and something is wrong and I'm scared too."

It all came out in one breath, like a dam breaking.

Mrs. Henderson was quiet for a long time. Then she said, "I'll be right over."

When she got there, she didn't yell at me. She didn't lecture me about responsibility or make me feel stupid. She just went straight to Bean's closet and looked at Scoops.

"Oh, honey," she said, but she was talking to the cat, not to me. "You're almost there, aren't you?"

"Almost WHERE?" I asked.

Mrs. Henderson looked at me. Her face did something complicated—a little bit of frustration, a little bit of sympathy, a lot of tiredness.

"Frankie, this cat is going to have kittens. Tonight, probably. Maybe tomorrow morning if we're lucky. She's in labor."

"Labor like... working hard?"

"Labor like giving birth. Her body is getting ready to push out the kittens. That's why she's acting strange. That's why she won't eat. That's why she's making noises. This is what cats do right before they become mothers."

I looked at Scoops. Scoops looked at me. Inside her belly, kittens were getting ready to exist.

"What do I do?" I asked.

"Well." Mrs. Henderson sighed. "Ideally, you would have taken her to a vet days ago. But we're past that now. So we make do."

She sent me to get old towels from the linen closet. She had Bean bring his stuffed animals to his bed so Scoops would have more room. She arranged the towels into a proper nest, with walls on the sides so the kittens wouldn't roll away.

"Keep her warm," she said. "Keep her calm. Don't pick her up or move her around. Let her do what she needs to do. Cats have been having kittens for thousands of years without help—she'll figure it out. But if something goes wrong—if she's in labor for more than a few hours without any kittens, or if a kitten comes out but doesn't move, or if there's a lot of blood—you call me immediately. Got it?"

"Got it."

She stood up, groaning a little. "This is the most irresponsible responsible thing I've ever seen, you know that?"

"What does that mean?"

"It means you did everything wrong AND everything right at the same time. You kept a cat without permission, you didn't tell anyone she was pregnant, you tried to return her to the wrong people, and you waited until the last minute to ask for help." She paused. "But you also fed her, and you kept her safe, and you made sure she had a warm place to rest, and when things got scary, you called someone instead of pretending everything was fine. That last part is the important part."

I didn't know what to say. I felt like crying, but I wasn't sure if they were good tears or bad tears.

"Thank you for coming," I managed.

"Of course I came. You asked." She looked at me with an expression I couldn't quite read. "You know, my sister's runt kitten—the one I mentioned? She's so small. Needs someone to feed her every two hours, or she won't make it. Needs someone who pays attention. Someone who takes things seriously." She paused. "Even if they take them seriously in the wrong direction."

"I don't—"

"I'm not saying anything. Just thinking out loud." She patted my shoulder. "Call me if you need anything. Even if it's 3 AM. Even if it's not a 'real emergency.' Sometimes the non-emergencies are the important ones."

After she left, I sat outside Bean's closet. Bean had fallen asleep on his bed, surrounded by stuffed animals, still wearing his shoes because he'd forgotten to take them off. Scoops was breathing steadily, her eyes closed, her body working on something I couldn't see.

I opened my Documentation Notebook and started writing.

*Thursday 4:15 PM - Called Mrs. Henderson for help. This was not because of Rule 4. Rule 4 says to call for emergencies. This was not an emergency (probably). I called because I was scared and I didn't know what to do and I needed someone to tell me it would be okay.*

*Note: I should have noticed the cat was pregnant. The signs were there. The big belly. The nesting. The water drinking. Mr. Martinelli noticed right away. Mrs. Henderson noticed right away. I didn't notice because I was too busy thinking about rules.*

*Second note: Rules are not the same as doing the right thing. They can overlap. But they're not the same.*

I kept writing. I wrote down everything I should have noticed and didn't. Every sign I'd missed. Every moment where I'd convinced myself that following the rules meant I was being responsible, when really I was just avoiding the harder thing, which was admitting I didn't know what I was doing.

The list was very long.

By the time I finished, it was dark outside. Bean was still asleep. Scoops was still breathing. And I was still scared.

But at least I had asked for help. That had to count for something.

I didn't sleep. I sat outside Bean's closet with my Documentation Notebook and a flashlight, listening to Scoops breathe, waiting for whatever was going to happen next.

I was going to be a terrible lawyer.

But maybe that was okay.
