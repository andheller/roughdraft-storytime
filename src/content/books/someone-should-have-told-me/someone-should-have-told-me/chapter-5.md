# Take Care of Each Other

I have had better weeks.

But I have also had worse weeks, like the week Derek Kozlowski told everyone I ate a worm when I only HELD a worm, and also the week I had the flu and threw up in the car, and also the week Grandma's parrot learned to say my name in an angry voice, which still gives me nightmares.

This week was different. This week I followed every rule on the refrigerator and still ended up with five cats in my brother's closet.

It happened like this:

I woke up because someone was shaking me. I hadn't meant to fall asleep—I was supposed to be watching Scoops—but at some point my eyes had closed and the next thing I knew, Bean was standing over me with the biggest smile I had ever seen on his face.

"FRANKIE," he said. "FRANKIE. THERE'S TINY CATS."

For a second I didn't understand. Then I remembered where I was and what I was supposed to be watching, and I scrambled to the closet so fast I tripped over my own Documentation Notebook.

Scoops was lying on her side in the nest of towels. She looked exhausted, like she had just run a marathon or taken a very hard test. But she also looked proud, in the way that cats look proud, which is basically how they always look but more so.

And next to her, curled up against her belly, were four kittens.

They were tiny. So tiny. The biggest one was the size of my hand, and the smallest one was the size of my hand if I made a fist. They were wet and wriggly and their eyes were closed and they were making tiny squeaking sounds that didn't sound like cats at all. They sounded like questions.

"They're so SMALL," Bean whispered, like he was in church or at the library.

"They just got born. They'll get bigger."

"Are they diggers?"

"They're CATS, Bean."

"Tiny cats."

"Yes."

"Tiny cats that I get to NAME."

I was too overwhelmed to argue. Four kittens. Scoops had four kittens in Bean's closet while I was sleeping, and now there were five cats in our house instead of one, and Mom was going to be home in eight hours, and I had no idea what I was going to say.

Actually, that's not true. I knew exactly what I was going to say. I had practiced it in my head all night, between naps. I was going to explain everything, rule by rule, decision by decision, and show Mom that even though things had gotten a little out of control, I had technically followed all the rules and therefore couldn't be blamed.

It was a good plan. A lawyer plan.

I just wasn't sure it was the right plan anymore.

---

Mom came home at 5:30, earlier than usual, because her training had ended early and she wanted to "check in on how things were going."

Things were going... complicated.

"Frankie?" Mom called from the front door. "Bean? How was your—"

She stopped. Because Bean was standing in the hallway holding a kitten, and the kitten was mewing, and behind Bean I was standing with an expression that probably looked like someone who had done something they needed to explain but didn't know how to start.

"What," Mom said, very slowly, "is that?"

"A baby tiny cat," Bean said. "Her name is Digger. I have three more. They're all named Digger."

Mom looked at the kitten. She looked at Bean. She looked at me.

"Frankie. Explain."

So I did.

I told her about Monday, and the cat showing up, and how I'd decided she wasn't technically a friend so Rule 1 didn't apply. I told her about the snack drawer and how I'd replaced everything so she wouldn't notice. I told her about Mrs. Henderson thinking the cat belonged to the Martinellis, and the trip to Oak Street, and Mr. Martinelli saying it wasn't his cat. I told her about calling Mrs. Henderson when I got scared, and how she'd said the cat was in labor, and how I'd stayed up all night waiting.

I told her everything, in order, with documentation.

When I finished, Mom was sitting on Bean's bed. She hadn't said a word the whole time. The quiet was worse than yelling. The quiet was the worst thing.

Finally, she spoke.

"Frankie. Do you understand why I'm upset?"

"Because I didn't tell you about the cat?"

"That's part of it."

"Because there are five cats in Bean's closet now?"

"That's also part of it."

"Because I used emergency money to buy replacement snacks?"

"I didn't even know about that part, but yes, add it to the list." Mom rubbed her face with her hands. "Frankie. The rules were not a puzzle to solve. They weren't a game where you find loopholes and technically-this and technically-that. They were supposed to help you make good decisions."

"I DID make good decisions," I said. "I made the BEST decisions. I documented everything. I followed the rules exactly. I—"

"You hid a pregnant cat from me for a week."

"But I—"

"You let your five-year-old brother feed her snacks until she ate everything in the drawer."

"That was—"

"You tried to return her to strangers without even checking if she was really their cat."

"Mrs. Henderson said—"

"And you didn't tell me ANY of this until right now, when you're standing in front of me with a closet full of kittens."

I didn't have a response to that. Because she was right. I had done all of those things. They just didn't feel wrong when I was doing them because the rules said I was okay.

But the rules weren't really okay. I just wanted them to be.

"I'm sorry," I said, and I meant it. "I thought if I followed the rules, nothing could go wrong. And then things kept going wrong anyway, and I didn't know how to fix it, so I just... kept following the rules."

Mom looked at me for a long time. Then she sighed—not an angry sigh, just a tired one.

"What are we going to do with five cats?"

I didn't have an answer.

Mrs. Henderson knocked on the door twenty minutes later.

She was carrying a cat carrier, and inside the carrier was a very small orange kitten—much smaller than any of Scoops' kittens, small enough to fit in a teacup.

"The runt," she said, when Mom opened the door. "My sister's cat had five kittens three weeks ago, and this one isn't thriving. Vet says she needs bottle feeding every two hours, lots of attention, someone who can really focus on her. I'm too old for that. I was going to take her to the shelter, see if they could help, but..." She looked past Mom, at me. "But then I thought about Frankie."

"Me?" I said.

"You've been taking care of that cat all week. Even when you shouldn't have been. Even when it made no sense. Even when it meant bending every rule in your little notebook." She held up the carrier. "This kitten needs someone who takes things too seriously. Someone who writes everything down. Someone who won't give up just because things get hard."

I stared at the kitten. She was so small. Her eyes weren't even open yet. She was mewing, a tiny sound that was barely louder than breathing.

"Mrs. Henderson," Mom said carefully, "I'm not sure this is the best time—"

"It's exactly the right time." Mrs. Henderson looked at Mom. "Your son made a lot of mistakes this week. But he also did something right: when things got scary, he asked for help. He didn't pretend everything was fine. He admitted he didn't know what to do." She paused. "That's harder than following rules. That's the thing that actually matters."

Mom looked at me. I looked at Mom. The kitten mewed.

"This is not a reward," Mom said finally. "Do you understand that, Frankie? If we take this kitten—and I'm not saying we ARE, but IF—it's not because you did a good job this week. It's because the kitten needs help and you might be able to give it."

"I understand."

"You'll have to feed her every two hours. That means setting alarms. That means waking up at night. That means actually being responsible, not just technically responsible."

"I know."

"And the other cats—Scoops and her kittens—we'll need to find homes for them. We can't keep five cats, Frankie. We just can't."

"I know," I said again. But I was looking at the runt in the carrier, and she was looking at me—except she couldn't actually look at me because her eyes were closed, but it felt like looking anyway. It felt like she was asking me something.

"I'll do it," I said. "I'll take care of her. Really take care of her. Not because the rules say I can, but because she needs me."

Mom was quiet for a long moment. Then she nodded.

"Okay. But I'm holding you to that."

Mrs. Henderson handed me the carrier. The kitten inside was warm, even through the plastic. She squeaked when I took her, like she knew something important was happening.

"What are you going to name her?" Bean asked, crowding close to look.

I thought about it. The whole week, Bean had named everything—the cat, the kittens, probably some of the stuffed animals. But this one felt different. This one was mine.

"Actually," I said, "you can name her."

Bean's face lit up. "Really?"

"Really."

He thought about it very seriously, the way he thinks about important things, like which flavor of ice cream is best (chocolate, always chocolate) and whether dinosaurs or diggers would win in a fight (diggers, because they have shovels).

"Peanut," he said finally. "Because she's small like a peanut."

"Peanut," I repeated. It was a good name. A small name for a small cat.

"That's a good name," Mrs. Henderson said.

"Bean is good at names," I admitted.

That night, after Mom had called three of her friends about taking kittens, and after Mrs. Henderson had gone home, and after Bean had finally fallen asleep surrounded by stuffed animals and exactly zero cats (Scoops and the kittens were in a proper box now, in the corner of my room where I could watch them), I did something.

I went to the refrigerator. I found a pen. And under the five rules Mom had written, I added a sixth:

*Rule 6: Sometimes the rules don't cover everything. Sometimes you have to figure it out yourself.*

In the morning, Mom saw it. I watched her from the kitchen doorway, nervous, waiting for her to be angry.

She wasn't angry. She read it twice, and then she laughed—a real laugh, not a tired one.

"You're going to be a lawyer someday," she said. "God help us all."

"Mrs. Henderson said the same thing."

"Mrs. Henderson is a wise woman." Mom looked at me. "Keep that rule. It's a good one."

Peanut slept in my room that first night, in a box with a heating pad and a towel that smelled like my sweater. I set my alarm for every two hours, just like the vet had said. At 2 AM, I fed her with a tiny bottle, and she drank so much that her belly got round like a marble. At 4 AM, I fed her again, and she fell asleep in my hand before she was even done.

Bean wanted to help, but he's five, and five-year-olds need their sleep.

"I'll do it," I told him. "I'm in charge."

And this time, I actually was.

*Final entry in the Documentation Notebook:*

*This week I learned that following rules is not the same as doing the right thing. Sometimes they overlap. But sometimes you have to do the right thing even when there's no rule for it. And sometimes you have to ask for help, even when you're scared, even when it means admitting you don't know what you're doing.*

*Also I learned that cats can have kittens in closets, and that kittens are very small, and that small things need people who take them seriously.*

*Mrs. Henderson's runt kitten is called Peanut. She is mine now. She fits in one hand. She has to eat every two hours.*

*I'm tired.*

*But I'm also responsible.*

*The real kind.*
