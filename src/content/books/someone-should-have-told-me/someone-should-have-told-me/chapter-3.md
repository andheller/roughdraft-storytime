# Returning Is Not the Same as Getting Rid Of

Wednesday was better than Tuesday, if you don't count the part where I made Bean cry, and the part where I carried a cat across the neighborhood for no reason, and the part where the cat peed in Bean's backpack. Other than those parts, it was fine.

I woke up determined to do the right thing. Today was the day I would return Scoops to the Martinellis. I would be responsible. I would be mature. I would fix the problem I had technically not created but had also not prevented.

The problem was Bean.

Bean did not want to return Scoops. Bean had made this very clear by sleeping in front of his closet door like a human barricade, with Scoops curled up next to him, both of them looking at me like I was the villain in a movie.

"Bean," I said. "We talked about this."

"I don't remember that conversation."

"It was yesterday. You were there. You said 'we're not really giving her back, right?' and I said 'we have to.'"

"I don't remember."

Bean's memory is very selective. He can remember every single promise I've ever made him, including the time I said "maybe" about getting ice cream, which he has interpreted as a blood oath. But he cannot remember anything inconvenient, like bedtimes or the fact that we have to return the cat.

"The Martinellis miss her," I tried. "She's THEIR cat. They've had her for years."

"She doesn't LIKE them. If she liked them, she would have stayed."

This was, unfortunately, a good point. Cats do have preferences. Maybe Scoops had left the Martinellis on purpose. Maybe she'd been unhappy. Maybe she'd seen Bean through the window and thought, "Yes, that's my human now."

But probably not. Probably she was just a cat who wandered, and she'd wandered to our house by accident, and now I had to wander her back.

"Bean," I said. "What if the Martinellis have a little girl? A little girl who's been crying every night because her cat is gone?"

Bean's face did something complicated. "They have a little girl?"

"Maybe. I don't know. But what if they do? And what if she's sad? What if she can't sleep because she misses her cat?"

I was making this up. I had no idea if the Martinellis had children. But Bean is five, and five-year-olds believe everything if you say it in the right voice.

"How sad is she?" Bean asked.

"Very sad. The saddest."

"Does she cry?"

"Every night. Into her pillow."

"Does she have a stuffed animal to hug instead?"

"No," I said, because I was committed now. "She only had the cat. The cat was her only friend."

This was too much. Bean started crying—not for himself, but for the imaginary Martinelli girl. He was crying so hard that Scoops woke up and started meowing, probably because she thought something was actually wrong.

"We have to give her back," Bean sobbed. "The little girl NEEDS her."

"Yes," I said. "That's what I've been saying."

"But I'LL be sad."

"I know."

"Will someone make up a story about ME being sad?"

"What?"

"When I'm sad about the cat, will someone tell a little girl that I'M crying? So she feels bad and gives me HER cat?"

I didn't know how to answer that. Bean's logic is like a maze with no exit.

"Let's just get the cat," I said.

Getting the cat was harder than expected.

Scoops did not want to leave the closet. When I tried to pick her up, she hissed at me—actually HISSED, like a snake with fur—and retreated deeper into the pile of stuffed animals.

"She's mad at you," Bean said, which was not helpful.

"She's a CAT. Cats don't get mad."

"Scoops does. She's mad because you're trying to return her. She knows."

Scoops did seem to know. Every time I reached for her, she scooted away. Her belly was even bigger today, so big that she moved slowly, like it was hard to carry. She looked exhausted just from the effort of avoiding me.

"She's tired," I said. "Look at her. She's barely moving."

"She's resting," Bean said. "For the journey."

"What journey?"

"The journey HOME. To the Martinellis. She needs her strength."

This was surprisingly thoughtful for Bean. I almost felt bad about the whole thing. Almost.

Finally, I got Scoops into Bean's backpack. It was the only bag big enough, and also the only bag Scoops didn't hiss at, probably because it smelled like Bean. I left it unzipped so she could breathe, and I carried it very carefully, like I was carrying something precious, which I was, even if I didn't want to be.

Bean walked next to me, holding my other hand, sniffling.

"Will she remember us?" he asked.

"Cats don't really remember things."

"Scoops does. She remembered which closet was best. She remembered which drawer had snacks."

"That's instinct, not memory."

"What's instinct?"

"It's like... knowing something without learning it."

"So she INSTINCTS us?"

"That's not a verb."

"Everything can be a verb if you try hard enough."

The Martinellis lived on Oak Street, which was four blocks away in a direction I didn't usually go. The houses there were bigger than ours, with gardens that looked like someone actually took care of them instead of just hoping the plants would figure it out themselves.

We found the right house by the address Mrs. Henderson had mentioned. It was blue with white shutters and a porch with chairs that matched. There was a garden gnome by the front steps, smiling in a way that seemed threatening.

I knocked on the door.

A man answered. He was older than my dad, with gray hair and glasses and a mustache that looked like it took a lot of work to maintain.

"Can I help you?" he said.

"Are you Mr. Martinelli?"

"I am."

"I think we have your cat." I held up the backpack, which meowed on cue.

Mr. Martinelli looked at the backpack. He looked at me. He looked at Bean, who was still sniffling. Then he looked back at the backpack.

"That's not my cat," he said.

My stomach dropped. "What?"

"That's not my cat. Our cat was a boy, first of all. An orange and white tabby. This cat is orange all over."

I looked at Scoops through the gap in the backpack. She was orange all over. I had noticed she had white paws, but now that I looked more carefully, her paws were orange too. Light orange, but still orange.

"But Mrs. Henderson said—"

"Mrs. Henderson?" Mr. Martinelli shook his head. "Nice lady, but she's not great with animals. She once told me my dog was sick because he was panting. In July. Dogs pant, that's what they do."

"So this isn't your cat?"

"Never seen her before." He squinted at the backpack. "She's pregnant, though. Very pregnant. You might want to get her checked out."

"She's WHAT?"

"Pregnant. Going to have kittens. Soon, by the look of it." He smiled, like this was good news and not the worst news I had ever heard. "Congratulations. You're going to be a cat grandpa."

I didn't know what to say. I just stood there, holding a backpack full of pregnant cat that didn't belong to anyone, while Bean tugged at my sleeve.

"Frankie," he said. "Frankie. She's not their cat."

"I know."

"That means we can KEEP her."

"That's not—that's not how it works."

But also, kind of, that WAS how it worked. If Scoops didn't belong to the Martinellis, and she didn't have a collar, and no one had put up any signs looking for her... then she was a stray. A real stray. And strays need homes. And we had a home.

And apparently, we were about to have kittens.

The walk back was quiet. Scoops had peed in the backpack at some point, probably from the stress, and the backpack was now garbage. Bean didn't seem to care. He was too busy being excited.

"How many kittens do you think?" he asked.

"I don't know."

"Can I name them?"

"I don't know."

"Can I name them ALL Digger?"

"That's confusing."

"Digger One, Digger Two, Digger Three—"

"That's STILL confusing."

We passed Mrs. Henderson's house on the way home. She was in her driveway, unloading a cat carrier from her car. There were sounds coming from inside it—not one cat sound, but multiple. She looked even more tired than before.

"How'd it go?" she called out.

"It wasn't their cat."

"What?"

"The Martinellis. It wasn't their cat. Mr. Martinelli said so. He said she's pregnant."

Mrs. Henderson stared at me. Then she started laughing, but not the funny kind of laughing. The kind of laughing where you're so overwhelmed you don't know what else to do.

"Of course she is," she said. "Of COURSE she's pregnant. Because that's what I needed. More cats in the neighborhood."

"I'm sorry?"

"Don't be sorry. It's not your fault. I shouldn't have told you she was the Martinellis' cat without checking." She hefted the carrier, and something inside it meowed. "I've got to get these inside. Three cats from my sister. Including a runt that won't eat right and probably needs bottle feeding every two hours, which I absolutely do not have time for."

"That sounds hard," I said, because what else do you say?

"It IS hard. I'm sixty-three years old and I'm becoming a cat lady against my will." She looked at me. "You don't want a kitten, do you? Once yours are born? Save me from having to find homes for four more cats?"

"No," I said automatically. "I don't think—my mom wouldn't—"

"Fair enough." She went inside, still muttering.

Bean was quiet until we got home. Then he looked at me with the most serious expression I'd ever seen on his face.

"Frankie."

"What?"

"Kittens are like tiny cats, right?"

"Yes."

"And tiny cats are like tiny diggers?"

"No. That doesn't make sense."

"Everything makes sense if you think about it right," Bean said, which is the most Bean thing anyone has ever said.

I put Scoops back in Bean's closet. She seemed relieved, curling up immediately in her nest of stuffed animals. Her belly rose and fell with her breathing. Inside that belly were kittens. Real kittens. Kittens that I hadn't asked for and didn't know how to take care of.

I wrote in my Documentation Notebook: *Wednesday 4:47 PM - Cat is NOT Martinellis' cat. Cat belongs to no one. Cat is also pregnant. This is not something I planned. This is not something I asked for. This is happening anyway.*

*Note: Mrs. Henderson has a runt kitten she can't take care of. This is not relevant to my situation. I'm just writing it down because it happened.*

I didn't know why I wrote that last part. It just seemed important.
