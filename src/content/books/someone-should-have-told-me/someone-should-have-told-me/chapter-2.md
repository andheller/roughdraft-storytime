# An Emergency Is When Someone Is Dying

Tuesday was also fine, probably. It depends on how you define fine, and also how you define emergency, and also whether Mrs. Henderson was right about the cat, which she wasn't, but I didn't know that yet.

The problem started at breakfast.

"Where are the granola bars?" Mom asked, looking in the snack drawer, which was empty because a cat had eaten everything in it, which was not my fault for reasons I have already explained.

"I don't know," I said, which was a lie, but a small one. A technical lie. Because I didn't know where the granola bars were NOW. They had been in a cat, but they had probably been processed by now, so they were somewhere ELSE, and I didn't know where. See? Technical truth.

"Frankie." Mom was using her I'm-not-mad-I'm-confused voice, which is actually worse than her mad voice because at least the mad voice is predictable. "There was a whole box of granola bars in here yesterday."

"Scoops ate them," Bean said, because Bean has never met a secret he didn't want to tell.

"Who's Scoops?"

"The cat. The one who lives in my closet. You said we could keep her."

Mom looked at me. I looked at the floor. The floor didn't look back because floors can't look, but I wished it would, so I'd have someone on my side.

"I didn't say you could keep a cat," Mom said slowly. "I said 'that's nice.' To something I wasn't listening to. That's not the same as permission."

"It sounded like permission," Bean said.

"Benjamin."

When Mom uses our real names, things are serious. My real name is Francis, which I don't like because it sounds like an old guy who does crossword puzzles and complains about the weather. Frankie is better. Frankie sounds like someone who has a skateboard, even if he doesn't actually have a skateboard.

"The cat is temporary," I said quickly. "She's a stray. She was hungry. Rule 5 says take care of each other, and technically the cat is—"

"The cat is not 'each other.' The cat is a CAT."

"That's what I said," I told Bean, but Bean wasn't listening. He had gone to check on Scoops, who was still in his closet, doing whatever cats do in closets. Sleeping, probably. Or plotting. It's hard to tell with cats.

Mom had to leave for her training, so she didn't have time to solve the cat problem. She just pointed at me and said, "We will discuss this tonight. Don't do anything else that requires discussion."

"Define 'anything else,'" I said, but she was already gone.

Here's the thing about Tuesday: I had a plan. The plan was simple. I would take some of the money from the emergency jar in the kitchen, walk to the store, buy replacement snacks, and put them in the drawer before Mom got home. She would never know about the Cat Snack Incident. It would be like it never happened.

But there were problems with this plan.

Problem 1: The store was four blocks away, which meant going OUTSIDE outside, not just backyard outside. Rule 3 said stay inside.

Problem 2: I couldn't leave Bean alone. He's five. Five-year-olds cannot be left alone. They do things like put syrup in the DVD player or try to give the toaster a bath. Bean once tried to mail himself to Grandma. In a box. He was in the box for twenty minutes before I found him.

Problem 3: I couldn't take Bean WITH me, because Rule 3 said he had to stay inside, and I wasn't sure if "going to the store" counted as inside or outside. Stores are inside. But you have to go OUTSIDE to get to them. It was a philosophical problem.

That's when I remembered Rule 4: Call Mrs. Henderson if there's a real emergency.

I thought about this. An emergency is when someone is dying, or the house is on fire, or there's a stranger trying to get in. That's what emergencies are. Needing snacks is not an emergency.

But what if I DIDN'T get snacks? Then there would be no snacks in the drawer. And tomorrow, when Bean wanted a snack, there would be nothing to give him. He would be hungry. Hungry children can get sick. Sick children can... okay, I was reaching. But it was ALMOST an emergency. A pre-emergency. And preventing emergencies is just as important as responding to them. Probably.

I called Mrs. Henderson.

"Hello?" She sounded tired. She always sounds tired.

"Mrs. Henderson, this is Frankie. From next door."

"I know who you are, Frankie. Is everything okay?"

"Yes. I mean, probably. I need to go to the store, and I was wondering if you could watch Bean for twenty minutes. It's sort of an emergency. A pre-emergency."

There was a long pause. I could hear something in the background—a meowing sound, but not from my house. Multiple meowing sounds.

"Frankie, I'm in the middle of a SITUATION. My sister has decided I need to take her cats. CATS. Plural. She had kittens three weeks ago—the cat, not my sister—and now Sandra wants me to take TWO of them AND the mother. And APPARENTLY there's a runt she can't find a home for, so she wants me to take THAT too. THREE CATS, Frankie. I don't even like ONE cat."

"That sounds hard," I said, because that's what you say when adults complain.

There was a pause. "What store do you need to go to?"

"The one on Miller Street. Four blocks."

"I need cat food anyway. Bring Bean over, I'll take you both. But we're going FAST, Frankie. I don't have time for browsing."

We walked to Mrs. Henderson's house first. She looked even more tired in person. There were cardboard boxes everywhere and a cat carrier sitting by the door, empty but waiting.

"Don't touch anything," she told Bean. Then to me: "Let's go."

The walk to the store was quick. Mrs. Henderson walks fast for someone who's always tired. Bean had to half-jog to keep up, which he thought was a game. Mrs. Henderson bought a giant bag of cat food and some cans of something called "kitten formula," muttering the whole time about runts and her sister's inability to plan ahead.

I bought granola bars, cheese sticks, apple slices, and fish crackers. I used the emergency money. I would replace the emergency money later, somehow. That was a future problem.

On the walk back, Bean tried to tell Mrs. Henderson about diggers, but she was too busy complaining about litter boxes to listen.

"That your snacks?" she asked, looking at my bag.

"Replacement snacks," I admitted.

"What happened to the original snacks?"

"A cat ate them."

Mrs. Henderson stopped walking. She looked at me with an expression I couldn't read. Then she started walking again.

"I need to see this cat," she said.

We went back to my house. Bean led her straight to his closet like he was giving a museum tour. "This is Scoops," he announced. "She likes cheese sticks and sleeping and being orange."

Scoops was lying on her side on a pile of Bean's stuffed animals. She looked bigger than yesterday. Her softball belly was more like a basketball belly now. When she saw us, she didn't get up. She just lifted her head, meowed once, then put her head back down.

"Huh," said Mrs. Henderson.

"She's been drinking a lot of water," I said. "I think she's thirsty."

"She's drinking a lot of water," Mrs. Henderson repeated, but in a different voice. Like the words meant something different when she said them.

"And she's heavier. I picked her up yesterday and she felt lighter. Cats must get heavier when they're full."

"Cats get heavier when they're full," Mrs. Henderson said, still in that strange voice. "Yes. That's... one reason."

She looked at Scoops for a long time. Then she looked at me.

"That's not a stray," she said. "That cat belongs to someone. I've seen her before. I think she's the Martinellis' cat, from over on Oak Street. They've had her for years."

My stomach did something uncomfortable. "Are you sure?"

"Pretty sure. Orange tabby, white paws, that little notch in her ear? That's their cat."

I looked at Scoops. Scoops looked at me. She did have white paws. She did have a notch in her ear. I hadn't noticed because I'd been too busy documenting the snack situation.

"So I... stole someone's cat?"

"I don't think you STOLE her. I think she wandered over and you fed her. But yes, technically, that cat belongs to the Martinellis, and they probably want her back."

"She CHOSE us," Bean said, his voice wobbling. "She came to OUR house. She likes OUR closet."

"Cats don't get to choose," Mrs. Henderson said. "Cats are property. You have to return her."

"Tomorrow," I said quickly. "I'll return her tomorrow."

"Why not today?"

I didn't have a good answer for that. The real answer was: because Bean was looking at me like I was about to ruin his life, and I didn't want to be the person who ruined Bean's life. Not today. Maybe tomorrow I could be that person, but not today.

"I need to figure out where Oak Street is," I said, which was partly true.

Mrs. Henderson gave me a look that said she knew that wasn't the real reason. But she didn't argue.

"Tomorrow," she said. "First thing."

"First thing," I agreed.

After she left, Bean hugged Scoops very carefully, like she was made of something breakable.

"We're not really giving her back, right?" he whispered.

"We have to. She's not our cat."

"But she FEELS like our cat."

"Feelings don't count," I said, but even as I said it, I knew that wasn't true. Feelings count. They just don't count as EVIDENCE.

I wrote in my Documentation Notebook: *Tuesday 5:23 PM - Cat possibly belongs to Martinellis on Oak Street. Will return tomorrow. Decision to wait one more day was made for emotional reasons, which are not legally binding but are also not technically against any rules.*

I didn't DECIDE to keep her. I decided to return her tomorrow. Those are completely different decisions.
