# Everyone Thinks I'm Crazy

Dr. Reyes had a nice office.

There were plants on the windowsill and a bowl of candy on her desk. The chairs were soft and squishy. On the wall was a poster of a cat hanging from a branch that said "Hang In There!"

Fig looked at the poster and said, "That cat seems stressed."

I tried not to laugh. Dr. Reyes noticed.

"Something funny, Benjamin?"

"No. Sorry."

She smiled. She had a kind smile, the kind that made you want to trust her. But I didn't trust her. I didn't trust anyone my parents had called "a professional who can help."

"Your parents told me you have a friend named Fig," Dr. Reyes said. "Can you tell me about Fig?"

I looked at Fig, who was sitting in the chair next to me. Fig gave me a small nod.

"Fig is my best friend," I said. "We met when I was five."

"And what does Fig look like?"

"Brown hair. Messy. A striped shirt. About my age."

Dr. Reyes wrote something down. "And where is Fig right now?"

I pointed to the chair next to me. "Right there."

Dr. Reyes looked at the empty chair. She looked at me. She wrote something else down.

"Benjamin," she said gently, "do you know what an imaginary friend is?"

"Fig isn't imaginary."

"I understand it feels that way. But sometimes, when children feel lonely, they create friends in their minds. It's very normal. It's actually a sign of creativity and intelligence."

"Then why is Fig in the photos?"

Dr. Reyes paused. "What do you mean?"

"The photos. Fig is in all of them. My mom can show you. Fig is in pictures from before I was born."

Dr. Reyes's smile stayed the same, but something behind her eyes shifted.

"Benjamin, that's not possible. Photographs capture reality. If your friend isn't real—"

"Fig IS real." I stood up. I didn't mean to, but I was angry. "I'm not crazy. I'm not making things up. Fig is sitting RIGHT THERE and just because you can't see them doesn't mean they don't exist!"

The room went quiet.

Fig was looking at me with wide eyes. Nobody had ever stood up for Fig before. Not like that.

Dr. Reyes put down her pen.

"I believe that YOU believe Fig is real," she said carefully. "And we can talk about why that is. But Benjamin, there's no one in that chair. There's no one in your photographs. Whatever you're seeing... we need to figure out what's happening."

I looked at Fig.

Fig was crying. Quiet tears, rolling down their cheeks.

"She can't see me," Fig whispered. "No matter how hard I try. She can't see me."

And that's when I realized: this wasn't about proving Fig was real. Dr. Reyes would never believe me. My parents would never believe me. The whole world would look at that empty chair and see nothing.

But I saw Fig. I ALWAYS saw Fig.

And that had to be enough.

The car ride home was silent.

Mom kept glancing at me in the rearview mirror. Dad stared straight ahead.

"Dr. Reyes thinks we should try some new strategies," Mom said finally. "She thinks if we stop... encouraging the behavior... Fig might fade away on their own."

"Fig isn't a behavior," I said.

"Benjamin—"

"Fig is my FRIEND. My only real friend. The only person who actually listens to me, who actually SEES me, who doesn't just nod and say 'that's nice, honey' while looking at their phone."

The car got very quiet.

Mom's hands tightened on the steering wheel.

"That's not fair," she said, but her voice was shaky.

"Isn't it?"

We drove the rest of the way in silence.

That night, Fig sat at the end of my bed.

"I'm sorry," Fig said. "This is all my fault. If I hadn't shown up in the photos, none of this would be happening. Your parents wouldn't be scared. You wouldn't be in trouble."

"You didn't do anything wrong."

"I made things harder for you."

"No." I sat up. "You made things better. You've ALWAYS made things better. And I'm not going to let them make you disappear."

Fig looked at me. "What are you going to do?"

I thought about it. About Dr. Reyes and her empty-chair theory. About my parents and their fear. About Fig, who had waited so long, SO long, just to be seen.

"I'm going to tell them the truth," I said. "Not about whether you're real or imaginary. About what you mean to me. About why I need you."

"And if they don't listen?"

I looked at my best friend—my impossible, unexplainable, absolutely-real-to-me best friend.

"Then I'll make them listen," I said. "Because that's what friends do."

Fig smiled. The whole-face smile.

For the first time in days, so did I.
