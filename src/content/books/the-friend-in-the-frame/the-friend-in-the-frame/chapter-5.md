# The Conversation

I found my parents in the kitchen, sitting at the table with the photos spread out between them.

They weren't arguing anymore. They weren't even talking. They were just staring at the pictures like they might reveal their secrets if they looked long enough.

"Can I talk to you?" I said.

They looked up. Mom's eyes were red. Dad looked tired.

"Of course, buddy," Dad said. "Come sit."

I pulled up a chair. Took a breath.

"I know you think I'm making Fig up," I said. "I know Dr. Reyes thinks I'm lonely and creative and that this is some kind of coping thing. And maybe you're right. Maybe I AM lonely. Maybe I DO need someone to talk to."

Mom reached across the table like she wanted to take my hand. I let her.

"But here's the thing," I continued. "Fig has been there for me when nobody else was. When you're at work and I come home to an empty house, Fig is there. When I can't sleep because the house is too quiet, Fig tells me stories. When I eat dinner alone, Fig sits with me."

Mom's hand tightened on mine.

"I'm not saying it's your fault," I said quickly. "I know you have to work. I know you love me. But I need you to understand—Fig isn't a problem. Fig isn't something that needs to be fixed. Fig is my FRIEND. The best friend I've ever had."

The kitchen was quiet.

"And I don't know why Fig is in the photos," I said. "I don't know how it's possible. Maybe it's magic. Maybe it's science. Maybe it's something nobody will ever be able to explain. But instead of trying to make it go away, maybe you could just... accept it? Accept that I have a friend you can't see, and that's okay?"

Dad rubbed his eyes. Mom was crying again—but differently this time. Not scared crying. Something else.

"Benjamin," Dad said slowly, "what you said about being lonely... we had no idea."

"We've been so busy," Mom said. "With work, with everything. We didn't realize—" She stopped. Took a breath. "We didn't realize you needed us and we weren't there."

"Fig was there," I said. "Fig is always there."

Mom looked at the photos. Really looked at them, for the first time.

"This one," she said softly. She pointed at a picture from Christmas. "Look at... at the expression on the face. Whoever—whatever this is—they look..."

"Hopeful," Dad said.

"Hopeful," Mom agreed. "Like they're waiting to be noticed."

She flipped to another photo. My seventh birthday. Fig standing next to me, almost touching my shoulder but not quite.

"And this one. They look nervous. Like they're not sure if they belong."

She looked up at me.

"Benjamin... is that how Fig feels? Like they don't belong?"

I thought about Fig. About the striped shirt from another time. About the In-Between. About waiting for years and years just for someone who could see you.

"Fig just wants to be part of a family," I said. "Fig has been alone for a really long time."

Mom was quiet for a long moment.

Then she did something I didn't expect.

She picked up one of the photos—the one from my birthday, where Fig's face was clearest—and she looked right at it.

"Hi, Fig," she said. "I'm Sarah. Benjamin's mom."

Dad stared at her. I stared at her.

"I can't see you," Mom continued, still looking at the photo. "I don't understand any of this. But my son loves you, and you've been there for him when I wasn't. So... thank you. And if you want to be part of this family..." She swallowed. "Then I guess you're part of this family."

From the doorway, invisible to everyone but me, Fig made a sound like a sob.

"She's talking to me," Fig whispered. "Benjamin. She's TALKING to me."

I smiled.

"Yeah," I said. "She is."

Dad looked at Mom like she'd lost her mind. Then he looked at the photo. Then at me.

"I'm not saying I believe in ghosts," he said slowly. "But I'm also not saying I DON'T believe. Because I've looked at these photos a hundred times, and I can't explain what I'm seeing. And if you say Fig is real..." He sighed. "Then I'm going to trust you, buddy. I'm going to trust that you see something we can't."

"Thank you," I said.

"So." Dad drummed his fingers on the table. "What does Fig like for breakfast? Because if they're part of this family, they're eating at the table with us."

I laughed. The first real laugh in weeks.

And from the doorway, Fig laughed too.
