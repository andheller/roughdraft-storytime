# The Old Albums

Mom became obsessed with the photos.

She dug out every album we had—the dusty ones from the closet, the boxes from the garage, the folders on her computer labeled "Backup DO NOT DELETE." She spread them across the dining room table and went through them one by one, like a detective looking for clues.

"What are you doing?" I asked, standing in the doorway.

"Looking," she said without looking up. "If this... if there's really something in the pictures, I want to know when it started."

"It started at my birthday," I said. "I told you."

But she wasn't listening. She was flipping through photos from last Christmas. Then from the summer. Then from the school year before that.

I watched her face change.

"David?" she called. Her voice was strange. "David, come here."

The photos were spread out in a line.

Each one had Fig in it.

Not in the background anymore—in the *middle*. Standing next to me at the school play. Sitting beside me at the breakfast table. Peeking over my shoulder while I opened presents.

"These are from two years ago," Dad said slowly. "This is from... this is from when you were seven."

"Fig has been my friend since I was five," I said.

Mom and Dad looked at each other.

"Okay," Mom said. "Okay. That's... that doesn't make sense, but okay. Let's keep looking."

She pulled out an older album. The one with the faded cover and the yellow pages.

Baby pictures. My first steps. The day they brought me home from the hospital.

Mom flipped through the pages. I watched her hands shake.

And then she stopped.

There, in a photo of me as a baby—tiny, red-faced, wrapped in a blanket in my mother's arms—was a blur near the window.

A blur shaped like a kid.

"That's not possible," Dad whispered. "Benjamin was a NEWBORN. He didn't have an imaginary friend when he was a newborn."

Mom kept flipping. Her hands moved faster now.

My first birthday. Fig in the background, blurry.

My second birthday. Fig a little clearer.

My third birthday. Fig standing right next to me, both of us reaching for the candles.

"I don't understand," Mom said. "I don't—how is this—"

She flipped back further. To photos from before I was born.

The photo of Mom and Dad at their anniversary dinner, a year before I existed. And in the corner of the restaurant, sitting alone at a table, was a kid with messy brown hair and a striped shirt.

Waiting.

"Fig," I said that night. "What ARE you?"

Fig was sitting on my bed, knees pulled up to their chest. Fig looked smaller than usual. Scared.

"I don't know," Fig said. "I really don't know."

"You're in photos from before I was born. You were there before I even existed."

"I was waiting." Fig's voice was barely a whisper. "I was waiting for someone who could see me. And then you came, and you SAW me, and I wasn't alone anymore."

"But how long were you waiting?"

Fig didn't answer.

"Fig. How long?"

"A long time." Fig's eyes were shiny, like they were about to cry. "A really, really long time, Benjamin. I don't know how long. I don't remember when it started. I just remember being alone. And then I remember you."

I didn't know what to say. So I did what Fig always did for me when I didn't have words.

I listened.

"I just wanted to be real," Fig said. "I wanted to be part of something. Part of a family. I didn't mean to scare anyone. I didn't mean to show up in the photos. I just wanted it so badly that it... happened."

"You wanted to be seen."

"I wanted to MATTER." Fig looked at me. "You're the only person who ever made me feel like I mattered. And I thought maybe, if I could be in the pictures, I could matter to your parents too. I could be part of your family. Not just your imaginary friend."

The words hit me somewhere deep.

"You're not imaginary to me," I said. "You never were."

Fig smiled. A small, sad smile.

"I know," Fig said. "That's why I picked you."

Downstairs, I could hear my parents arguing.

"We need to take him to someone," Mom was saying. "A doctor. A therapist. Something."

"And tell them what? That there's a ghost in our photos?"

"It's not a ghost. It's—I don't know what it is. But something is wrong."

I looked at Fig.

Something is wrong, Mom said.

But looking at Fig—at my best friend, my only real friend, the person who'd been there for me when no one else was—nothing felt wrong at all.
