# Family Portrait

Fig eats pancakes.

I didn't know imaginary friends could eat, but apparently they can—or at least, Fig can. Every morning, Mom sets out four plates instead of three. Four glasses of orange juice. Four napkins.

"More syrup, Fig?" she asks, holding the bottle toward the empty-looking chair.

I pass the syrup.

"Fig says thank you," I report.

"You're welcome, Fig," Mom says.

Dad still looks slightly uncomfortable with all of this. But he's trying. Yesterday he asked Fig about the weather, and when I translated Fig's answer ("Fig says it feels like a 'between day'—not warm, not cold, just in-between"), Dad nodded seriously and said, "I know exactly what you mean, Fig."

He doesn't know what Fig means. But he's trying, and that matters.

Things are different now.

Mom works from home two days a week. Dad comes home earlier. We eat dinner together—all four of us—almost every night.

"How was school?" Dad asks.

"Fine," I say. "We had a spelling test."

"How'd you do?"

"I got a ninety-two. I missed 'necessary.'"

"That's a hard one," Mom says. "How about you, Fig? How was your day?"

I look at Fig, who is beaming.

"Fig says they reorganized my bookshelf by color," I translate. "And they found a quarter under my bed."

"Very productive," Dad says. "Good work, Fig."

Fig doesn't stop smiling for the rest of dinner.

We never figured out what Fig is.

Not a ghost, exactly—ghosts are supposed to be dead people, and Fig doesn't remember ever being alive. Not a hallucination—hallucinations don't show up in photographs. Not a spirit or a demon or an angel or any of the things Dad quietly Googled late at night when he thought I wasn't watching.

Fig is just... Fig.

Something that exists in the In-Between. Something that waited a long, long time to find a friend. Something that wanted so badly to be real that it started to become real, one photograph at a time.

We don't understand it.

But we've stopped trying to understand it.

Some things just are.

The holiday card this year has four people in it.

Mom, Dad, me, and Fig.

We took the picture in front of the fireplace. Dad set up the tripod. Mom wore her red sweater. I wore the uncomfortable collared shirt I only wear for pictures.

And Fig stood right next to me, arm around my shoulder, grinning at the camera.

"Everyone say 'cheese'!" Dad said.

"Cheese!" said Mom and me.

"Cheese!" said Fig, even though no one else could hear it.

The camera flashed.

And when we looked at the photo—really looked at it—there was Fig. Clear as day. Part of the family.

Mom started to cry again. The happy kind this time.

"We should send this to Grandma," she said.

"Grandma's going to have questions," Dad pointed out.

"Grandma's going to have to deal with it," Mom said. "Fig is family now."

That night, after the cards were addressed and the dishes were washed and the house was quiet, Fig sat with me on the porch.

It was cold outside, but not too cold. A between kind of night.

"Thank you," Fig said.

"For what?"

"For not giving up on me." Fig looked at the stars. "Everyone else did. Everyone else looked right through me. But you saw me. And you fought for me. And now..."

Fig gestured at the house behind us. At the warmth through the windows. At the stack of holiday cards with four faces instead of three.

"Now I'm part of something," Fig finished.

I leaned my head against Fig's shoulder. Fig felt solid and real and there.

"You always were," I said. "You just didn't know it yet."

We sat there for a while, watching our breath fog in the cold air.

Two breaths. Side by side.

Both real.

Both here.

*Nobody ever figured out what Fig was.*

*The mystery stayed a mystery.*

*But that was okay.*

*Because Fig was family now.*

*And family doesn't need an explanation.*

*Family just needs a place at the table.*
