# The Blur Gets Clearer

Over the next few weeks, Fig started showing up everywhere.

Not in real life—Fig was always there in real life. I mean in pictures.

First it was the photo Dad took of me doing homework. I was at the kitchen table, frowning at a math worksheet. Behind me, near the refrigerator, there was a blur.

"Lens flare," Dad said.

Then it was the picture Mom took for Grandma, the one of me in my new winter coat. I was standing by the front door, smiling the kind of smile you make when someone tells you to smile. And in the mirror behind me, there was a shape. A kid-shaped shape.

"Weird reflection," Mom said.

Then it was the selfie I took with Mom at the park. We were on a bench, leaves falling around us. And between us, squeezed into the frame like they'd been there all along, was a face.

Not a blur this time. A *face*. Messy brown hair. A nervous smile.

Fig.

"Mom," I said, "do you see that?"

She looked at the photo. Her eyebrows went together the way they do when she's confused.

"See what, honey?"

"Between us. There's—" I pointed at the screen. "Right there. That's Fig."

Mom was quiet for a long moment. Then she laughed, but it wasn't a funny laugh.

"That's just... that's a glitch, Benjamin. Phones do weird things sometimes."

She deleted the photo.

That night, Fig sat in my desk chair, spinning slowly.

"She deleted it," I said.

"I know."

"You were RIGHT THERE. Your face was right there."

Fig stopped spinning. "Did I look okay?"

"What?"

"In the picture." Fig looked embarrassed. "Did I look okay? I've never been in a picture before. I didn't know if I was doing it right."

I didn't know what to say. Fig was worried about their *angle*.

"You looked fine," I said. "You looked... real."

Fig smiled. That big, whole-face smile.

"I felt real," Fig said. "For just a second, when the camera clicked, I felt really, really real."

The pictures kept coming.

At my cousin's wedding, Fig appeared in the background of seventeen different photos. Tiny at first—just a blur behind the cake table—but getting clearer each time. By the last photo of the night, you could see the stripes on Fig's shirt.

At Thanksgiving, Fig was in the family portrait. Standing right next to me, clear as day, while everyone else smiled at the camera.

My uncle posted it on Facebook. Nobody commented on the extra kid.

"Why can't they see it?" I asked Fig later. "It's so obvious. You're RIGHT THERE."

Fig shrugged. "Maybe they don't want to see it. Grown-ups are like that sometimes. They only see what makes sense."

But then Mom found the birthday photos.

It was a Sunday afternoon. She was cleaning out the junk drawer, and she found the stack of printed photos from my party—the ones Grandma had insisted on printing because "phones break, but photographs last forever."

I was in my room when I heard her gasp.

Then: "David? DAVID. Come look at this."

I crept to the top of the stairs. My parents were in the kitchen, hunched over the photos, flipping through them one by one.

"This one too," Dad said. "And this one. And—oh. Oh, that's..."

"Who IS that?" Mom's voice was shaking. "That's not a smudge. That's not a lens flare. That's a CHILD."

I looked at Fig. Fig looked at me.

"They can see me," Fig whispered. "Benjamin. They can *see* me."

Fig looked terrified.

And honestly? So was I.

That night, my parents sat me down at the kitchen table. The photos were spread out in front of us like evidence.

"Benjamin," Dad said carefully. "Is there something you want to tell us?"

I looked at the photos. At Fig's face, getting clearer and clearer with each one. At Fig's hopeful, scared expression.

And then I looked at the corner of the kitchen, where Fig stood, invisible to my parents, watching with wide eyes.

"That's Fig," I said. "My friend. I've been telling you about Fig for years."

Mom and Dad exchanged a look.

"Fig is... imaginary, sweetheart," Mom said gently.

"Then how is Fig in the pictures?"

Neither of them had an answer for that.
