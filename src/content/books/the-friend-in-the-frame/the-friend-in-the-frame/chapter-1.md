# My Best Friend Fig

I met Fig when I was five years old.

It was the summer we moved to the new house, the one with the big backyard and the creaky stairs. Mom and Dad were busy unpacking boxes, and I was sitting on the porch, watching ants carry crumbs across the wood.

"Those ants are working really hard," said a voice next to me.

I looked up. There was a kid sitting there—about my age, with messy brown hair and a striped shirt that looked like it was from a long time ago. The kind of shirt you see in old photographs.

"I'm Fig," the kid said. "Want to be friends?"

I did want to be friends. I wanted it more than anything.

So I said yes.

Here's the thing about being an only child: it's quiet.

My parents love me. I know they do. But Dad works late most nights, and Mom has her phone pressed to her ear so often that I sometimes forget what her voice sounds like when it's not saying "Sorry, can you hold on one second?"

Fig doesn't have a phone. Fig doesn't have anywhere else to be.

When I come home from school, Fig is waiting in my room. When I can't sleep, Fig tells me stories about a place called the In-Between, which sounds made up but also sounds kind of real. When I eat dinner alone because Mom's on a conference call and Dad's still at the office, Fig sits across from me and asks about my day.

"Tell me everything," Fig says. "I want to know everything."

So I tell Fig everything. And Fig listens like it matters.

My parents don't see Fig.

I figured this out pretty early. When I was six, I asked Mom to set an extra place at dinner for Fig, and she laughed and said, "Of course, sweetie," in that voice adults use when they're not really listening. She put out a plate, but she kept glancing at her phone.

"She can't see me," Fig said quietly. "It's okay. I'm used to it."

"Used to it?"

Fig just shrugged. "Some people can see me. Most people can't. You can. That's what matters."

I stopped asking for extra plates after that. But I always saved Fig half my dessert. Just in case.

The first photograph happened on my ninth birthday.

It was a small party—just me, Mom, Dad, and a cake from the grocery store. Dad set up his phone on a tripod (he's very into photography "as a hobby," which mostly means he takes blurry pictures of birds).

"Okay, everyone squeeze in!" Dad said.

Mom put her arm around me. I smiled. Fig stood behind us, near the window, waving at the camera.

"Can Fig be in the picture too?" I asked.

Mom's smile flickered. "Sure, honey. Fig can be in the picture."

She didn't look at the window. She didn't see Fig waving.

Dad clicked the button. The phone flashed. And that was that.

Later that night, after cake and presents and the awkward silence when my parents ran out of birthday conversation, I looked at the photo on Dad's phone.

There we were—Mom, Dad, and me, squished together in front of my cake.

And behind us, near the window, was a blur.

A blur shaped like a person.

"Dad?" I said. "What's that?"

He squinted at the screen. "Huh. Must be a smudge on the lens. Or maybe the light was weird." He swiped to the next photo, a blurry picture of a sparrow. "Don't worry about it."

But I did worry about it.

Because the blur had messy brown hair. And I could almost—*almost*—see stripes.

That night, Fig sat on the edge of my bed while I stared at the ceiling.

"Fig?"

"Yeah?"

"Were you trying to be in the picture?"

Fig was quiet for a long moment. When I looked over, Fig's face was strange. Hopeful and scared at the same time.

"I just wanted to be part of it," Fig said. "Part of the family. Is that... is that okay?"

I didn't know what to say.

So I just said, "Yeah. That's okay."

Fig smiled—the real kind of smile, the kind that takes over your whole face.

"I'll try harder next time," Fig said. "Maybe they'll see me. Maybe they'll all see me."

I didn't know if that was a good thing or a scary thing.

But Fig looked so happy that I didn't have the heart to say anything else.
