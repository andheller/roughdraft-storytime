# The Worst Best Day

I had a plan.

The plan was called "Maya's Perfect Dog Plan" and it lived in a spreadsheet on Mom's computer. I'd been adding to it for seven months. There were columns for breed, size, speed, trainability, and "likelihood to go running with me every single morning." I had researched. I had prepared. I had ranked seventeen different dogs from best to worst based on data.

And then I went to the shelter and they gave me Speedy.

Let me back up.

The day started perfectly. Saturday morning, 8:47 AM—a little behind schedule, but acceptable. Mom drove me and my brother Leo to the Greenbrook Animal Shelter, which was hosting an adoption event. I had printed out information on three dogs I wanted to meet. I had backup options. I had questions prepared for the shelter workers.

Leo had a folded-up piece of paper that he wouldn't let me see.

"It's a map," he said.

"A map of what?"

"Things."

Leo is six, and his answers are like that. Short. Unhelpful. He's been making maps for months—of what, I don't know. Last week I saw one labeled "SQUEAKY GATES OF MAPLE STREET (RANKED BY SQUEAKINESS)." The week before that: "SNAILS I HAVE MET." He draws little symbols and legends and everything. It's weird, but it keeps him busy.

At the shelter, I walked in with purpose. I knew exactly which kennels to visit. I knew exactly which dogs matched my criteria.

That's when I saw him.

Kennel 14. A lean, athletic mutt with long legs and alert eyes. The card on his cage said ROCKET. Rocket! That was the perfect name. He looked fast. He looked eager. He looked like he wanted to run five miles every morning and then do it again.

"That one," I said to Mom. "Rocket. He's perfect."

The shelter worker—a tired-looking woman with a ponytail and dog hair on her shirt—checked her clipboard. "Rocket? Oh, honey. He was adopted about five minutes ago."

Five minutes.

I had lost my perfect dog by five minutes because Leo had to stop and look at a weird crack in the parking lot. (He's mapping those too, apparently. "Cracks That Look Like Animals." We were late because of one that "kind of looked like a duck if you squinted.")

"We have other dogs," the worker said. "Actually, we have a special needs placement that would be perfect for a responsible kid like you."

I should have said no. I should have stuck to the spreadsheet. But Mom was giving me the look that meant *be polite*, and the worker was already leading us to the back.

That's where I met Speedy.

Speedy was lying in her kennel like she'd been waiting for me specifically. She was medium-sized, brown and white, with soft eyes and a tail that wagged slowly when she saw me—and I do mean *slowly*, like she was conserving energy for something more important later.

She also had three legs.

"What happened to her leg?" I asked.

"She was born this way," the worker said. "Some dogs just are. She gets around fine. She's very sweet. Very calm."

"Calm" was not on my spreadsheet. "Calm" was the opposite of what I wanted. I wanted *energetic*. I wanted *athletic*. I wanted a dog who would keep up with me.

"Her name is Speedy," the worker added.

I looked at the three-legged dog lying completely still in her kennel. "Is that... a joke?"

"The volunteers named her. They have a sense of humor."

Speedy lifted her head, looked at me, and yawned. It was the slowest yawn I'd ever seen. It lasted approximately four seconds. I know because I counted.

"She's perfect," Mom said.

"She has three legs."

"She has a good heart."

"Hearts aren't on my spreadsheet."

"Maya."

And that's how I ended up walking out of the shelter with a three-legged dog named Speedy who did not, in any way, live up to her name.

Our first walk was a disaster.

I had planned a route: two blocks to the park, one lap around, two blocks home. Total distance: 0.4 miles. Estimated time: twelve minutes if we walked briskly, fifteen if we took it easy.

Actual time: forty-seven minutes.

I know because I have a stopwatch app on my phone, and I started it the moment we left the house.

Here's what happened:

0:00 - Left the house. Speedy stood on the porch and sniffed the air.
0:23 - Still sniffing the air.
0:41 - Speedy took one step forward.
0:58 - Speedy stopped to sniff a crack in the sidewalk.
2:14 - Still sniffing the crack.
2:15 - I tried to gently pull the leash. Speedy did not move.
2:47 - Speedy finished sniffing the crack. Took three steps. Found another crack.
3:12 - Sniffing the new crack.

You get the idea.

In forty-seven minutes, we made it two blocks. Speedy stopped to smell fourteen different things: three cracks, two patches of grass, one fire hydrant (for four minutes and twelve seconds—I timed it), one spot where there used to be a puddle but wasn't anymore, one perfectly normal section of concrete that I couldn't identify as special in any way, one leaf that had blown away before she finished smelling it, and five things I couldn't even see.

I started a note on my phone called "Speedy's Smell Log." It seemed important to document.

By the time we got home, I was exhausted, and Speedy looked exactly the same as when we'd left: calm, unhurried, mildly pleased with herself.

"How was the walk?" Mom asked.

"We went two blocks."

"That's nice."

"It took forty-seven minutes."

"She's getting used to the neighborhood."

"She smelled things that don't exist, Mom. She smelled where a leaf USED to be."

Mom just smiled. "Give her time."

I didn't want to give her time. I wanted a dog who could keep up with me. Instead, I had a dog who treated every walk like a museum tour, stopping at each exhibit to fully appreciate its aroma.

Later that afternoon, I was sitting on the front porch, watching Speedy lie in the grass and do absolutely nothing, when I saw a kid walking across the parking lot of the apartment complex next door.

He was carrying a small glass tank with both hands, very carefully, like it contained something precious. Or dangerous. Or both.

I recognized him from school—Ben something. He was in my grade but not my class. He was the quiet kid who always seemed to be thinking about something nobody else was thinking about.

"Hey," I called out. "What's in the tank?"

He stopped walking. Looked at me. Looked at the tank. Looked back at me.

"My chameleon," he said. His voice was completely flat, like he was reporting the weather.

"Cool. What color is it?"

"Brown."

"Like, right now? Or—"

"Always. It's brown. It doesn't change colors." He said this the same way you'd say "the sky is blue" or "water is wet." Just a fact. "Did you know chameleons can move their eyes independently? They can look at two different things at once."

"That's cool."

"Camo looks at two walls at the same time. That's his main activity."

I wasn't sure if this was a joke. Ben's face gave no indication.

"I got a dog today," I said, gesturing at Speedy, who was still lying in the grass. "She's supposed to be a runner. Her name is Speedy."

Ben looked at Speedy. Speedy didn't move.

"She doesn't look speedy."

"She's not. At all. She has three legs and stops to smell everything. Our first walk took forty-seven minutes to go two blocks."

"Did you know dogs can smell 10,000 to 100,000 times better than humans?" Ben said. "Forty-seven minutes for two blocks is actually pretty efficient if you think about all the information she's processing."

I hadn't thought about it that way. It didn't make me feel better.

"What's wrong with your chameleon?" I asked. "Why won't it change colors?"

Ben shrugged. One shoulder, minimal effort. "I don't know. I've tried everything. Different lighting, different temperatures, different backgrounds. I even played him videos of other chameleons changing colors. He watched for a while, then looked away. I think he was unimpressed."

"That's... weird."

"It's fine. He's committed to being brown. I respect his commitment."

I stared at Ben. Ben stared back. His face was completely neutral.

"I'm Maya," I said.

"I know. You're in Mrs. Patterson's class. I'm Ben."

"Your chameleon—"

"Camo."

"Right. Camo. Does he do anything? Besides being brown?"

"He eats. He sleeps. He looks at walls. Sometimes he looks at me, but I think that's accidental." Ben paused. "Did you know chameleons can see ultraviolet light? He probably sees things I don't. Maybe that's why he doesn't care about regular colors. He's already seen better ones."

I couldn't tell if Ben was sad about his broken chameleon or if this was just how he talked about everything. Either way, there was something almost peaceful about his acceptance. His chameleon was brown. That was a fact. He'd moved on.

"Want to sit down?" I asked. "I'm watching my dog do nothing. You could watch with me."

Ben considered this. Then he walked over and sat on the porch steps, setting the tank carefully beside him. Inside, a brown chameleon sat on a branch, being brown.

We sat there for a while, watching our disappointing pets.

"I wanted a dog that could run," I said eventually.

"I wanted a chameleon that would be impressive," Ben said. "Something I could show people. Something that would do tricks. Or at least change colors."

"What happened?"

"This." He gestured at the tank. "He was the only one left at the pet store. The sign said 'LAST ONE—NEEDS A GOOD HOME.' I thought he'd be grateful. You know, try harder for me because I rescued him."

"Did he?"

"He looked at me once. Then he looked at the wall. He's been looking at walls ever since."

Speedy lifted her head, sniffed the air, and put her head back down.

"Same," I said.

When Mom called me in for dinner, Leo came running up from wherever he'd been exploring, clutching his latest map.

"Maya! Maya! Look what I found!"

"Not now, Leo."

"But I mapped the whole neighborhood! I found seventeen hiding spots! Some are really small. I ranked them by size!"

"That's great."

"And there's one really good one that I couldn't fit into. It's under something. I marked it with a star because it's important."

I wasn't really listening. I was too busy thinking about Speedy, and Ben's chameleon, and how the day was supposed to go differently.

"Maybe you can help me check it tomorrow?" Leo asked. "The small one. I need someone with longer arms."

"Maybe," I said, which is what you say when you mean "no but I don't want to argue."

Leo ran inside, still talking about his map, about hiding spots and stars and things that were "too small for now but maybe later."

I looked back at Speedy. She was standing now—slowly, like even standing was an activity that deserved careful consideration. She walked over to me, three legs moving in an awkward rhythm that somehow looked graceful, and put her head against my knee.

"You're not what I wanted," I told her.

She wagged her tail. Slowly.

"But I guess you're what I got."

She leaned into my leg, warm and solid and completely unhurried.

I scratched behind her ears, and for a second, I stopped thinking about spreadsheets and plans and everything that had gone wrong. For a second, I just had a dog, and the dog was here, and that was something.

It wasn't enough. But it was something.
