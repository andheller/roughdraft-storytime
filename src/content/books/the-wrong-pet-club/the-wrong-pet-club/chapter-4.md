# Lost

The morning of the parade, Leo was gone.

Not missing-missing. Not at first. Just... not in his room when Mom went to wake him up. His bed was made (badly, but made), his pajamas were on the floor, and his backpack was gone. So were his rain boots, even though it wasn't raining.

"He probably went to play in the backyard," Dad said.

He wasn't in the backyard.

"Maybe he walked to the park."

He wasn't at the park.

"He's six," Mom said, and her voice had that edge to it now, the one that meant she was trying not to panic. "Where would a six-year-old GO?"

That's when I saw his map.

It was on his desk, pinned under a rock he'd collected last month (labeled, of course: "ROCK FROM MR. DAVIDSON'S DRIVEWAY - SPARKLY"). The hiding spots map. The one he'd been working on for weeks.

One spot was circled three times in red. Next to it, in Leo's crooked handwriting:

**THE SMALL ONE**
**UNDER THE SHED**
**TODAY!!!**
**NEED FLASHLIGHT**

My stomach dropped.

"Mom," I said. "I think I know where he went."

The old Miller property was four blocks away, at the edge of the neighborhood where the houses stopped and the overgrown lots began. The Millers had moved out years ago, and nobody had bought the place since. There was a rusted fence, a yard full of weeds, and a shed that looked like it might collapse if you breathed on it.

And apparently, under that shed, there was a hiding spot that Leo had been dying to explore.

A hiding spot he thought might contain Mrs. Park's lost watch.

I ran the whole way. Speedy, somehow, kept up—three legs pumping, ears flying, not stopping to smell a single thing. It was the fastest I'd ever seen her move.

Mom and Dad were calling people, organizing a search. I should have waited for them. I should have been responsible and patient and done everything properly.

But Leo had been trying to show me that map for a week. He'd asked for my help, and I'd said "maybe later." Over and over. "Maybe later."

And now he was gone, and maybe later was too late.

---

I texted the group chat while I ran:

**Maya:** leo is missing
**Maya:** i think he went to the old miller property
**Maya:** the shed there
**Maya:** i'm going now

By the time I reached the property, Ben and Jenna were already there.

Ben had Camo's tank strapped to his chest with a makeshift harness. Jenna was carrying Duchess's carrier.

"Why did you bring your pets?" I gasped, out of breath.

"I don't know," Ben said. "It felt important."

"The carrier was by the door," Jenna said. "I grabbed it without thinking."

We stood at the rusted fence, looking at the overgrown yard. The shed was at the back, tilted slightly, half-covered in vines. It looked like something from a horror movie.

"Leo?" I shouted. "LEO!"

Nothing.

"Maybe he's not here," Jenna said.

"He's here. I know it. He's been planning this for WEEKS." I pulled up his map on my phone—I'd taken a picture of it last week, when he wouldn't stop showing it to me. "Look. The star spot. It's right there, under the shed."

"Under it?"

"There's a crawlspace or something. He said he couldn't fit, but he wanted to check it. He thought that's where Mrs. Park's watch might be."

"Mrs. Park's watch?" Ben asked.

"It's a long story. He's been looking for it. Like a treasure hunt."

We climbed the fence—it was wobbly but held—and pushed through the weeds toward the shed. The closer we got, the worse it looked. The wood was rotten in places. There were holes in the walls. The door was hanging off one hinge.

"LEO!" I shouted again.

This time, I heard something. Faint. Muffled. Coming from underneath.

"MAYA?"

"LEO! Where are you?"

"I'M STUCK!"

I dropped to my knees and looked under the shed. There was a gap between the bottom of the structure and the ground—maybe a foot high, crawling with shadows. I couldn't see anything.

"Are you hurt?"

"No! But I can't get out! There's a hole and I fell in and now I can't climb back up!"

"Okay. Okay. We're going to get you out." I looked at Ben and Jenna. "We need to get under there."

"I'll go," Ben said immediately.

"You?"

"I'm the smallest. And—" He hesitated. "And I need to do this."

Before I could argue, he was already on his belly, crawling into the gap under the shed. Camo's tank was still strapped to his chest, the chameleon inside looking as unbothered as ever.

"I can't see anything," Ben called back. "It's too dark."

"Leo! Keep talking so Ben can find you!"

"I FOUND THE WATCH!" Leo's voice echoed from somewhere in the darkness. "MRS. PARK'S WATCH! IT WAS HERE THE WHOLE TIME! BUT NOW I'M IN A HOLE AND I CAN'T—"

"I hear him," Ben said. "I'm going toward the voice."

We waited. It felt like hours but was probably only minutes.

Then Ben's voice, tight with worry: "There's a hole. Like a foundation crack or something. He fell in. It's about four feet deep. I can see him but I can't reach him."

"Can he climb out?"

"The walls are dirt. They keep crumbling when he tries."

I looked around frantically. We needed rope, or a ladder, or SOMETHING—

That's when Speedy started pulling at her leash.

I'd almost forgotten she was there. She'd followed me the whole way, keeping pace, not stopping to smell anything. But now she was straining forward, nose to the ground, sniffing with an intensity I'd never seen.

"What are you—" I started.

She pulled harder. Not toward the shed, but to the side of it. Around to the back.

"Speedy, this isn't the time for—"

But she wasn't doing her usual slow, methodical sniffing. This was different. Purposeful. Fast.

I let her lead me.

She went around the back of the shed, nose working constantly. Then she stopped at a pile of old boards and debris, half-covered in vines. She pawed at it. Whined.

"There's nothing here," I said.

She pawed again. More insistent.

I started pulling at the boards. Jenna appeared beside me and helped. We threw aside rotten wood and rusty metal and years of leaves until—

A hole. Another way into the crawlspace. Bigger than the gap at the front.

"BEN!" I shouted. "There's another entrance! At the back!"

A moment later, Ben's face appeared in the hole, dirt-streaked and relieved. "I see it! I can get to Leo from here!"

He crawled toward us, then dropped down into the hole where Leo was stuck. I heard scuffling, then Leo's voice, high with relief: "BEN! You found me!"

"Your sister's dog found you. I just followed."

They helped each other climb out of the hole—Leo first, then Ben. Leo was dirty and tear-streaked, but he was grinning. In his hand, clutched tight, was a gold watch.

"I FOUND IT!" he said. "I knew it was here! I KNEW it!"

I hugged him so hard I probably bruised something.

---

We were walking back toward the street—all of us exhausted, filthy, and shaky with relief—when Jenna suddenly stopped.

"Wait."

"What?"

She was looking at her cat carrier. Very carefully, she lifted it up and looked through the mesh.

Duchess was inside.

Not hiding. Not crouched in a corner that didn't exist. Just sitting there, calm and gray and fluffy, looking back at Jenna like this was a perfectly normal thing.

"When did you—" Jenna started. "How did—"

"She was in there the whole time," Ben said. "I saw her when we were climbing the fence. I thought you knew."

"I DIDN'T know. She's never IN there. I just carry it out of HABIT." Jenna was staring at her cat like she'd just witnessed a miracle. "Duchess. You're here. You're actually HERE."

Duchess meowed. A single, soft sound.

"That's the first time she's meowed at me when I could SEE her," Jenna whispered.

We all stood there for a moment, looking at the cat who finally decided to exist.

Then Leo tugged at my sleeve. "Maya. The watch. We have to give it to Mrs. Park."

I looked at the watch in his hand. It was old and gold and scratched from its time underground, but it was there. Real. Found.

"Yeah," I said. "We do."

---

Mrs. Park was in her front yard when we walked up, still dirty and disheveled from the rescue mission. She was talking to my mom, who looked like she'd aged ten years in the last hour.

"THERE you are!" Mom grabbed Leo and hugged him, then started the cycle of relief-turning-to-anger that I knew would last for the rest of the day. "What were you THINKING? You could have been HURT! You could have—"

"Mom," Leo said, squirming. "Mom. MOM. I found it."

He held up the watch.

Mrs. Park went very still.

"That's—" she started. "That's—"

"Your husband's watch," Leo said. "You said you lost it near your garden. But I checked all around your garden and it wasn't there. So I made maps of everywhere things could go, and I found a path that leads from your house to the old Miller property, and I thought maybe it fell out of your pocket while you were walking and rolled somewhere, and I checked all the hiding spots on the path, and the last one was under the shed, and—"

"Leo," I said gently. "Breathe."

"—and it was THERE. Right where I thought. In a hole under the shed. I found it."

Mrs. Park was crying. Not sad crying—the other kind. She took the watch from Leo's hand and held it like it was made of something precious. Which, to her, it was.

"My William gave me this watch on our wedding day," she said. "I've been looking for it for so long. I thought it was gone forever."

"It was just hiding," Leo said. "Everything hides somewhere. You just have to find where."

Mrs. Park hugged him. Then she hugged me. Then she hugged Ben and Jenna, who looked startled but didn't resist.

"Thank you," she said. "All of you. Thank you."

Later, after the lectures and the relief and the long hot showers, I sat on the porch with Speedy.

The parade was in two hours. We were still entered. We were still going to walk on stage with our wrong pets and probably embarrass ourselves.

But something felt different now.

Speedy had found the way in. Her nose—the same nose that spent forty-seven seconds smelling a fire hydrant, the same nose that stopped to sniff things that weren't there anymore—had found Leo.

She wasn't slow because she was broken. She was slow because she was THOROUGH.

"You found him," I said.

She wagged her tail. Slowly, like always.

"I thought you were smelling nothing. All those times. All those stops. But you were paying attention, weren't you? You were noticing things."

She put her head on my knee.

"I wanted a fast dog," I said. "I wanted a dog who could keep up with me. But maybe I'm the one who needs to keep up with you."

Speedy closed her eyes, content.

I scratched behind her ears and watched the street and thought about all the things I'd missed because I was too busy rushing.

Maybe wrong wasn't wrong.

Maybe wrong was just different.

And maybe different was exactly what I needed.
