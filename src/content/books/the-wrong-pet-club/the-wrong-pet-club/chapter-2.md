# The Club Nobody Wanted

By the end of the first week, I had started keeping official records.

The spreadsheet was called "Speedy's Smell Log" and it lived in my phone's notes app. Every walk, I tracked: time of day, weather, total duration, number of smell stops, average duration of each stop, and "notable objects sniffed."

After seven walks, the data was clear:

- Average smell stops per walk: 14.3
- Average duration per stop: 47 seconds
- Longest single stop: 4 minutes 12 seconds (fire hydrant, corner of Oak and Maple)
- Most confusing stop: 2 minutes 38 seconds (nothing visible—possibly a memory of a smell? Do smells leave ghosts?)
- Total distance covered in one week: 2.1 miles
- Total time spent: 5 hours 23 minutes

If you do the math, that's about 0.4 miles per hour. I could crawl faster than that. I could probably roll faster than that.

"You're collecting data," Ben said when I showed him. He was sitting on my porch again, Camo's tank beside him. This had become a routine. Every afternoon, Ben came over, and we watched our disappointing pets together.

"Data helps you understand things," I said.

"Does it help?"

"No. But at least I know exactly how much time I'm wasting."

Ben nodded slowly. "Did you know some scientists spent twenty years studying why chameleons change colors? Twenty years. And the answer was basically 'mood and temperature.' I read their whole paper. Camo still won't change colors."

"Maybe he's always in the same mood."

"Brown mood." Ben looked at his chameleon. Camo was sitting on his branch, looking at the side of the tank. "I respect it, honestly. Most people change who they are depending on who's watching. Camo is the same no matter what. That's integrity."

I couldn't tell if Ben actually believed this or if he'd just convinced himself to feel better about his useless pet. Either way, it was an impressive spin.

That's when Jenna showed up.

Jenna Price lived three streets over, and I knew her from school—everyone knew Jenna from school. She was loud, confident, always in the middle of everything. She had the kind of personality that filled a room, the kind of laugh you could hear from the cafeteria in the parking lot.

So I was surprised when she walked up to my porch looking like someone had just told her Christmas was cancelled.

She was carrying a cat carrier. It looked empty.

"Is that for your cat?" I asked.

Jenna set the carrier down on the porch with a thunk. "She's IN there."

I leaned over and looked through the mesh door. I saw: nothing. A blanket, a small toy, empty space.

"There's no cat in here."

"She's in the CORNER."

I looked again. There were no corners. Cat carriers are rounded. "Jenna, there is literally no cat—"

"She's THERE. She just... blends."

Ben peered into the carrier. "Is she a chameleon?"

"She's a CAT, Ben. A gray fluffy cat named Duchess."

"A gray fluffy cat should be visible."

"You would THINK." Jenna collapsed onto the porch steps, dropping her head into her hands. "I've had her for three weeks. I've seen her twice. TWICE. Both times she was mid-disappearance—like I caught the last half-second of her leaving a room."

I looked at the carrier again. Still empty. "How do you know she's real?"

Jenna's head snapped up. "Excuse me?"

"I'm just asking. Have you considered that maybe you don't actually have a cat?"

"The LITTER BOX is used, Maya. I don't know what else would be using the litter box. And the food disappears. Every day, the food bowl is empty in the morning."

"Could be raccoons," Ben said helpfully.

"Raccoons that use a litter box?"

"Did you know raccoons can be litter trained? They're actually very—"

"BEN."

Ben went quiet.

Jenna took a deep breath. "I wanted a cat I could photograph. I started an Instagram for her—@duchess_the_magnificent—before I even brought her home. I had plans. Photo shoots. Cute outfits. She was going to be FAMOUS."

I pulled out my phone and found the account. Jenna had 52 posts. I scrolled through them.

Photo of an empty windowsill. Caption: *Sunbathing.*
Photo of an empty cat bed. Caption: *Napping beauty.*
Photo of a slightly rumpled blanket. Caption: *She was just here. I SAW her.*
Photo of a single clump of gray fur on a pillow. Caption: *PROOF. Tell me she's not real NOW.*

The comments were brutal:
*where's the cat*
*is this a joke account*
*I literally see nothing*
*are you okay???*

And Jenna's replies:
*She's there. Look harder.*
*Behind the lamp. You can almost see her tail.*
*That's her EAR in the corner. Obviously.*

"This is deeply unhinged," I said.

"I KNOW." Jenna grabbed the carrier and shook it gently. Nothing moved inside. "Duchess. DUCHESS. Please just show them you exist."

Silence.

Then, from somewhere inside the carrier—maybe—a very soft meow.

"SEE?" Jenna said triumphantly.

"I didn't see anything. I HEARD something. That could have been you."

"Why would I meow at my own cat carrier?"

"Why would you post fifty pictures of an empty room?"

Jenna glared at me. I glared back. Ben watched us both with mild interest, like we were a nature documentary.

"Let's start over," I said. "I'm Maya. I have a three-legged dog who walks slower than continental drift. Ben has a chameleon who only does one color. And you have... a cat who may or may not exist."

"She EXISTS."

"We believe you," Ben said. He didn't sound like he believed her.

"This is Ben," I continued. "He says facts about animals when he's uncomfortable."

"Did you know cats can make over 100 different vocal sounds? Dogs can only make about 10." Ben paused. "That wasn't because I'm uncomfortable. That was just relevant."

Jenna looked at him for a long moment. Then she looked at me. Then she looked at Speedy, who was lying in the grass, sniffing a dandelion with the concentration of a detective analyzing evidence.

"What's wrong with your dog?"

"She stops to smell everything. Our walks take forever."

"What's wrong with his lizard?"

"Chameleon," Ben corrected.

"Whatever."

"He won't change colors. He's committed to brown."

Jenna sat back down on the porch. She looked exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with being tired.

"So we all have broken pets," she said.

"They're not broken," I said, though I wasn't sure I believed it. "They're just... not what we expected."

"Same thing."

Nobody argued with that.

---

That's how the Wrong Pet Club started.

It wasn't an official thing at first. It was just the three of us, sitting on my porch every afternoon, comparing disappointments.

Ben would update us on Camo's latest non-color-change. ("Today I tried putting him on a blue background. He stayed brown. I put him on a red background. Still brown. I think he's making a statement.")

Jenna would report on Duchess sightings—or the lack of them. She'd started keeping a log, like a field researcher tracking an endangered species:

> *Day 16, 0800 hours: Subject not visible. Food bowl empty. Litter evidence suggests activity between 0200-0400. No visual confirmation.*

> *Day 18, 1423 hours: Movement detected in peripheral vision. Gray blur, heading north. Duration: sub-one-second. Added to "inconclusive" tally.*

> *Day 21, 0312 hours: Auditory event. Single meow, origin unknown. Checked all rooms. Nothing.*

And I would share my Smell Log data, complete with charts and averages.

"This is sad," Jenna said one afternoon, looking at all of our notes. "We're documenting our failures."

"Data helps you understand things," I said.

"Does understanding help?"

"Not really."

But there was something comforting about it anyway. At least we weren't alone in our disappointment. At least someone else understood what it felt like to get the wrong pet.

That's when Leo showed up.

---

"MAYA!"

My brother came running around the corner of the house, waving a piece of paper over his head like he'd just discovered treasure. Which, knowing Leo, was probably exactly what he thought.

"I finished my new map!"

"That's great, Leo."

"It's HIDING SPOTS. Secret ones. I ranked them!"

He shoved the paper at me. I looked at it because it was easier than arguing.

It was actually impressive, in a weird way. Leo had drawn our whole neighborhood—streets, houses, trees, fences—and marked about twenty different spots with X's. Each X had a number next to it, and there was a legend at the bottom:

*HIDING SPOT RANKINGS*
*1 = Easy to find*
*2 = Medium hard*
*3 = Really hidden*
*4 = So secret even I forgot where it was*
*STAR = Need help to check*

Most of the spots were numbered 1 or 2. A few were 3. One, near the edge of the map, had a star next to it.

"What's the star one?" I asked.

"It's REALLY small. Under something. I can see it but I can't fit." Leo bounced on his heels. "Will you help me check it? Please? It's important."

"Why is it important?"

"Because I need to know what's there!"

"Why?"

"Because WHAT IF something is there?"

This was Leo logic. He didn't want to find anything specific. He just wanted to find SOMETHING. Any something. He'd been like this since he was four, always looking under rocks and behind bushes, always convinced there was treasure hidden everywhere if you just knew where to look.

"Maybe later," I said.

"You always say that."

"And I always mean it."

Leo pouted, but he was distracted a moment later by a beetle on the porch railing. He crouched down to examine it, probably planning to add it to some map of "Beetles I Have Seen."

"He makes maps?" Jenna asked.

"Of everything. He has one called 'Snails I Have Met.' Every snail in the neighborhood, named and categorized."

"That's... thorough."

"He's six."

Ben was looking at Leo's hiding spot map with genuine interest. "This is actually well-designed. Clear legend, consistent symbols, accurate scale."

"Please don't encourage him."

"I'm just saying. If he ever gets lost, this map would help you find him."

I took the map from Ben and handed it back to Leo. "Here. Go find more hiding spots."

Leo grabbed it and ran off, already scanning the yard for potential discoveries.

"Cute kid," Jenna said.

"He's exhausting."

"Same thing."

---

An hour later, we were still on the porch when an old woman walked by—Mrs. Park from two houses down. She was nice, quiet, always wearing cardigans even in summer.

"Hello, children," she said. "Have any of you seen a gold watch? I've been looking for it for months now. It was my husband's."

We all shook our heads.

"I lost it somewhere in the neighborhood. I was gardening, and then I went for a walk, and somewhere along the way..." She trailed off, looking sad. "It's probably in a storm drain by now. But I keep hoping."

"Did you know metal detectors can find things up to 12 inches underground?" Ben said. "Depending on the soil composition."

Mrs. Park smiled, but it was the kind of smile adults give when they don't know how to respond to a fact. "That's nice, dear. If you see anything shiny, let me know."

She walked on.

"That's sad," Jenna said. "Losing something from someone who died."

"Her husband died?" I asked.

"Like two years ago. My mom told me. Mrs. Park still talks about him sometimes."

We sat with that for a moment. Then Jenna shook her head and stood up.

"I should go. I need to check on Duchess. Make sure she still technically exists."

"Good luck," I said.

"Luck doesn't help. EVIDENCE helps. I'm setting up a motion-activated camera tonight. If she moves, I'll catch her."

"Did you know cats can move fast enough to—" Ben started.

"GOODNIGHT, BEN."

Jenna picked up her carrier—still apparently containing an invisible cat—and walked home.

Ben stood up too, carefully lifting Camo's tank. "Same time tomorrow?"

"Same time."

He nodded and left.

I sat on the porch alone, watching Speedy sniff the spot where the beetle used to be. She sniffed it for nearly a minute, even though the beetle was long gone.

"You're weird," I told her.

She wagged her tail.

Somewhere in the house, I could hear Leo talking to himself, probably planning his next map. Something about "places that smell funny" and "maybe treasure."

I picked up my phone and added an entry to the Smell Log:

*6:47 PM - Beetle location (vacant). Duration: 58 seconds. Notes: Beetle departed 23 minutes prior. Speedy does not seem to understand time.*

Then I put my phone away and just sat there, watching my weird slow dog smell things that weren't there anymore.

The Wrong Pet Club. It wasn't a real club yet. We didn't have rules or meetings or a secret handshake.

But we had each other.

And we had our wrong pets.

And for now, that was enough.
