# The Right Pets

The Greenbrook Annual Pet Parade was held in the town square at 3 PM.

By the time we got there, I'd almost forgotten we were supposed to perform. The whole morning had been so strange—Leo disappearing, finding him under the shed, Mrs. Park crying over her watch—that the parade felt like something from another life.

But here we were. The Wrong Pet Club. Ready to be weird in public.

The square was packed with kids and their pets. I saw golden retrievers with ribbons in their fur, cats in tiny costumes, a rabbit wearing a cape, and one extremely confused guinea pig in a princess dress. Everyone looked prepared. Everyone looked confident.

We looked like we'd just crawled out of a ditch.

Which, technically, we had.

"Maybe we shouldn't do this," I said.

"We already signed up," Jenna replied. "They called our names on the list."

"We could just... not go up."

"And waste my presentation?" She pulled out her phone. "I updated it. New title: THE WRONG PET CLUB: WHY OUR PETS ARE ACTUALLY GREAT."

"You updated it in the last two hours?"

"I'm motivated when I have feelings."

Ben was holding Camo's tank, looking calmer than anyone had a right to look. "We should tell them," he said. "About what happened. About how the pets helped find Leo."

"That's not really a trick."

"It's better than a trick. It's real."

I thought about that. Ben was right. We didn't have costumes or routines or anything impressive. But we had a story. And maybe that was worth something.

When they called "The Wrong Pet Club," we walked on stage together.

The judges sat at a long table with clipboards. The crowd was mostly parents trying to take pictures. The announcer looked bored, like he'd already seen too many pets today.

"And what category are you entering?" he asked.

I looked at Jenna. Jenna looked at Ben. Ben looked at Camo.

"Best Trick," I said.

The announcer raised an eyebrow. "Alright. And what's your trick?"

This was the part where we were supposed to do something. Speedy was supposed to sit or roll over or catch a frisbee. Camo was supposed to change colors. Duchess was supposed to exist visibly.

Instead, I said: "This morning, my dog found my brother."

The announcer blinked. "Excuse me?"

"My brother Leo was missing. He'd crawled under an old shed and gotten stuck in a hole. We couldn't find him. But Speedy—" I put my hand on her head. "Speedy found another entrance. She smelled her way to him. She stopped being slow and just... knew what to do."

The crowd had gone quiet. The judges were leaning forward.

"My chameleon helped too," Ben said. "Kind of. He was there. And I had to crawl into a really dark, scary place to get Leo, and I was terrified, but Camo was on my chest the whole time. Just being brown. Just being Camo." He paused. "Did you know chameleons can see in two directions at once? I think that helped me see better too. Maybe."

It didn't make total sense, but it was Ben, and nothing Ben said ever made total sense, and somehow that was fine.

Jenna stepped forward. "And my cat Duchess—"

She held up the carrier. Looked inside.

Empty.

"Oh no," she whispered. "No, no, no, she was JUST there—"

A meow came from somewhere. Not from the carrier.

We all looked up.

Duchess was sitting on the judges' table. Right in the middle. Right on top of a blue first-place ribbon. She was grooming her paw like she'd been there for hours.

"HOW—" the announcer sputtered. "When did—"

"That's her thing," Jenna said weakly. "She appears. And disappears. And appears somewhere else."

One of the judges reached out to touch Duchess. Duchess allowed it, regally, like she was granting a favor.

"She's real," the judge said, sounding surprised.

"I TOLD you she was real."

"She's beautiful. Why isn't she in the Most Photogenic category?"

"Because she doesn't show up in PHOTOS," Jenna said, and then started laugh-crying, which is something I didn't know was possible until that moment.

We didn't win Best Trick.

We didn't win any official category.

But at the end of the parade, after all the ribbons were given out and all the normal pets had done their normal tricks, the head judge stood up and cleared her throat.

"We have one more award to give out," she said. "This one isn't on the program. We made it up just now, because we didn't have a category for what we saw today."

She looked right at us.

"The award for Most Surprising goes to... The Wrong Pet Club."

The crowd applauded—actual applause, not just polite parent-clapping. Someone whistled. Leo, standing with Mom and Dad at the edge of the square, was jumping up and down yelling "THAT'S MY SISTER! AND HER WRONG DOG!"

The judge handed us a ribbon. It was handmade, clearly created in the last five minutes, with "MOST SURPRISING" written in marker on a piece of cardstock.

It was the best ribbon I'd ever seen.

After the parade, we walked home together. The sun was setting, turning everything gold and orange. Speedy walked beside me, stopping to smell things—a mailbox, a leaf, a crack in the sidewalk—and for the first time, I didn't check my stopwatch.

I just waited.

"Did you know dogs experience the world primarily through smell?" Ben said. "To them, every walk is like reading a newspaper. They're catching up on news."

"What kind of news?"

"Who was here. What they ate. Where they went. It's all information, just in a different format."

I watched Speedy sniff a fire hydrant. The same fire hydrant that had taken four minutes and twelve seconds on our first walk. She sniffed it for maybe thirty seconds this time, then moved on.

"She's getting faster," I said.

"Or you're getting slower," Ben replied.

I thought about that. Maybe he was right.

Jenna was looking into Duchess's carrier again. Duchess was inside, visible, curled up and sleeping.

"She's been in here the whole walk," Jenna said, wonder in her voice. "I keep checking and she keeps being there."

"Maybe she's tired from her big debut."

"Maybe." Jenna smiled. "Or maybe she finally decided I was worth showing up for."

She looked back through her phone at her Instagram. All those photos of empty rooms. All those comments asking "where's the cat?" and "is this a joke?"

"I should post a new photo," she said. "An actual photo. Of an actual cat."

"What would the caption be?"

Jenna thought about it. Then she grinned. "Finally."

When we got to my house, Leo was sitting on the porch, waiting.

He was holding his ribbon—a third-place ribbon for "Best Smile," which Mrs. Park had entered him in without telling anyone. Apparently, his grin after finding the watch had been photographed by half the crowd.

"Maya!" He jumped up. "Did you win?"

"We got Most Surprising."

"Is that good?"

"I think it's the best we could have hoped for."

He nodded seriously, like this made perfect sense. Then he looked at Speedy.

"She found me," he said. "Your slow dog found me."

"She did."

"So she's not really slow. She's just... careful. Right?"

I looked at Speedy. She was sniffing the porch, taking her time, processing information in a format I couldn't read.

"Yeah," I said. "She's careful. She notices things other people miss. That's her superpower."

"I want a superpower like that."

"You already have one. You make maps. You notice hiding spots. You found Mrs. Park's watch when nobody else could."

Leo beamed. It was the same smile that had won him third place.

"Can I join the Wrong Pet Club?" he asked.

"You don't have a pet."

"I have you guys. And you're all wrong. In a good way."

Jenna laughed. Ben nodded. I looked at my little brother, who had spent weeks making maps of snails and squeaky gates and hiding spots, who had believed he could find a lost treasure when everyone else had given up.

"Yeah," I said. "You can join."

That night, I lay in bed and thought about the week.

I thought about going to the shelter and losing Rocket by five minutes. I thought about meeting Ben in the parking lot with his brown chameleon, Jenna with her invisible cat. I thought about all those walks where Speedy stopped to smell things I couldn't see, all those times I'd been frustrated and impatient and convinced I'd gotten the wrong pet.

Maybe I had gotten the wrong pet.

But maybe wrong was just a different kind of right.

I grabbed my phone and opened the Smell Log. Fifty-three entries. Every stop, every duration, every confusing smell that made no sense.

I looked at the data for a long time.

Then I deleted it.

Not because it didn't matter. It mattered. It was real. But I didn't need to measure Speedy anymore. I didn't need to track how slow she was or how many times she stopped or whether she was meeting some standard I'd invented.

She was my dog. And she was exactly the dog I needed.

---

The next morning, I woke up early.

Speedy was lying by my bed, waiting. She did that every morning now—waited for me to wake up, then walked with me to the door, ready for whatever came next.

"Want to go for a walk?" I asked.

She wagged her tail. Slowly, like always.

We went outside. The sun was just coming up. The street was quiet.

Speedy sniffed the air. Then she sniffed a crack in the sidewalk. Then she sniffed a mailbox, and a patch of grass, and a spot where something used to be but wasn't anymore.

I didn't time it.

I didn't count the stops.

I just walked with her, slow and steady, noticing things I'd never noticed before. The way the light hit the trees. The sound of birds waking up. The feeling of morning, new and full of possibility.

Speedy stopped at the fire hydrant. The famous fire hydrant. The four-minute-twelve-second fire hydrant.

She sniffed it carefully, thoroughly, taking her time.

And I waited.

Not because I had to. Not because I was being patient.

Because I finally understood.

Some things are worth slowing down for.

*The Wrong Pet Club*
*Members: Maya, Ben, Jenna, Leo*
*Pets: Speedy (slow), Camo (brown), Duchess (cryptid)*
*Motto: "Wrong is just different. Different is just us."*

We never made it official. We never had membership cards or meetings or a secret handshake.

But we had each other. And we had our pets.

And that was exactly right.
