# The Parade Problem

The Greenbrook Annual Pet Parade was announced on a Tuesday.

I saw the flyers on my way to school—bright yellow paper stapled to every telephone pole and taped to every shop window. There was a cartoon dog on the front, wearing a tiny top hat, looking extremely pleased with itself.

**GREENBROOK PET PARADE!**
**Saturday, October 15th**
**Categories: Best Trick, Best Costume, Most Photogenic, Best in Show!**
**Prizes! Ribbons! Fun for the whole family!**

I took a picture of the flyer and sent it to the Wrong Pet Club group chat.

**Maya:** did you see this
**Jenna:** NO
**Jenna:** absolutely not
**Jenna:** i cannot enter a pet that no one can see
**Ben:** Camo's best trick is sitting on a branch. He does it automatically.

I stared at my phone and tried to imagine entering Speedy in "Best Trick."

"And what trick will your dog be performing today?"

"She stops walking. For forty-seven seconds. Every time she smells something."

"That's... not really a trick."

"She does it without being asked."

I put my phone away.

At lunch, the three of us sat together in the corner of the cafeteria, which had become our usual spot. Ben had his chameleon facts book open. Jenna had her phone out, scrolling through @duchess_the_magnificent comments.

"Someone asked if my account is a social experiment," she said. "They think I'm making an artistic statement about the nature of absence."

"Are you?"

"I'm making a statement about how my cat WON'T SHOW HER FACE."

She put her phone down and looked at us seriously. "I can't do the parade. I have 52 posts and zero cat photos. If I show up with an empty carrier, people will think I'm insane."

"You kind of are," I said.

"I'm DEDICATED. There's a difference."

Ben turned a page in his book. "Did you know chameleons don't really change color for camouflage? It's mostly for communication and temperature regulation. The whole 'blending in' thing is a myth."

"Fascinating," Jenna said flatly. "Does Camo communicate?"

"He communicates that he's brown."

"That's not communication. That's just... existing."

"Existing is a statement."

I couldn't tell if Ben actually believed this stuff or if he'd just gotten really good at philosophical deflection. Either way, he never seemed upset about Camo. He'd achieved some kind of zen acceptance that I couldn't manage with Speedy.

"What about you?" Jenna asked me. "Are you entering?"

I thought about it. I thought about Speedy's smell stops, her three-legged shuffle, her complete disinterest in doing anything quickly or impressively.

"What would I even enter for? Best Trick? Her trick is standing still."

"You could do Most Photogenic," Jenna suggested.

"She photographs fine. She just doesn't DO anything in photos. She looks like she's waiting for the photo to be over so she can go back to smelling things."

"Best Costume?"

"She'd stop to smell the costume before we got to the stage."

We sat in defeated silence.

Then Ben said, "What if we entered together? As a team?"

Jenna and I looked at him.

"A team of what?" I asked.

"The Wrong Pet Club. That could be our category. We're not competing to be the BEST. We're competing to be... us."

"That's not a category," Jenna said.

"We could make it one."

"You can't just make up categories."

"Why not? We made up a club."

He had a point. The Wrong Pet Club wasn't official. We didn't have rules or membership cards or anything. We were just three kids with disappointing pets who complained together.

"So what would we do?" I asked. "Walk on stage with a slow dog, a brown chameleon, and an empty cat carrier?"

"Yes."

"That's... actually kind of funny."

Jenna was quiet for a moment. Then she smiled—a real smile, not the forced one she'd been wearing since Duchess started her invisibility campaign.

"The Wrong Pet Club," she said. "Entering the pet parade with the wrong pets."

"It's stupid," I said.

"It's VERY stupid."

"Let's do it."

After school, we had our first official Wrong Pet Club meeting at my house.

The agenda:
1. Discuss parade strategy
2. Practice... something? (TBD)
3. Complain about our pets (ongoing)

Speedy was lying on the porch, sleeping. Camo was in his tank, looking at a leaf. Duchess was in her carrier, allegedly.

"Okay," Jenna said, pulling out her phone. "I've been thinking about this. If we're going to enter as a joke, we should COMMIT to the joke. Like, really lean into it."

"What does that mean?"

"I made a presentation."

She turned her phone around. The first slide said: **THE WRONG PET CLUB: PARADE STRATEGY**

"You made a presentation in the last two hours?"

"I'm motivated when I'm angry."

She swiped to the next slide: **OUR PETS' ABILITIES**

Under Speedy, she'd written: *Smelling things. Standing still. Walking slowly. Being patient.*

Under Camo: *Being brown. Looking at walls. Existing.*

Under Duchess: *Disappearing. Possibly not existing. Evidence suggests real.*

"This is accurate but painful," I said.

"That's the point. We're not pretending they're good. We're saying: 'These are our pets. They're weird. We love them anyway.'"

"Do we love them?" I asked.

Jenna paused. "I love the IDEA of Duchess. The actual Duchess remains unconfirmed."

Ben had been quiet this whole time. Now he spoke up. "I don't know if I love Camo. But I respect him. He knows who he is. He doesn't change for anyone."

"Because he CAN'T change."

"Maybe. Or maybe he won't. There's a difference."

I looked at Speedy, still sleeping on the porch. Did I love her? She wasn't what I wanted. She wasn't fast or athletic or anything on my spreadsheet. She was slow and stubborn and she smelled things that didn't exist.

But she was mine. And there was something kind of nice about that.

"Fine," I said. "We'll enter. But I'm not wearing a costume."

"Nobody's wearing costumes," Jenna said. "The pets are the statement."

"What statement?"

"That wrong is just... different. And different isn't bad."

It was almost inspiring. Almost.

That night, Leo knocked on my bedroom door.

"Maya? Are you busy?"

"Yes."

He came in anyway. He was holding his map—the one with the hiding spots—but it looked different now. More notes. More symbols. One spot was circled three times in red marker.

"I need your help tomorrow," he said. "With the star spot."

"I told you, maybe later."

"You've said that for a WEEK."

"And I'll keep saying it until later happens."

Leo's face did something complicated. He wasn't crying, but he wasn't far from it. "But it's IMPORTANT, Maya. I've been looking for something for Mrs. Park. Her watch. The gold one. I think I know where it might be, but I can't fit to check."

I sat up. "You're looking for Mrs. Park's watch?"

"She lost it. She told us. Remember? And I've been mapping all the places things could get lost—cracks and holes and drains and hiding spots. And there's one spot that's REALLY small, under a thing, near where she said she was gardening. And I think maybe—"

"Leo." I held up my hand. "That watch is gone. It's been months. It probably washed down a drain or got picked up by a bird or something. You're not going to find it."

"But what if I DO?"

"You won't."

"But what IF?"

I sighed. Leo's optimism was exhausting. He genuinely believed he could find a watch that had been missing for months, just by crawling around and checking hiding spots.

"Maybe this weekend," I said. "After the parade."

"PROMISE?"

"I... fine. I promise. After the parade, I'll help you check your dumb hiding spot."

Leo's face lit up. "It's not dumb. It's SECRET. And small. And kind of under a shed, I think. At the old Miller property. Where nobody goes."

"Great. Sounds safe."

"It IS safe. I checked. Well, I checked from the outside. I couldn't fit inside. That's why I need HELP."

He left, clutching his map, already planning his treasure hunt.

I went back to my homework, but I couldn't focus. I kept thinking about Mrs. Park's face when she'd asked about the watch. How sad she'd looked. How hopeful, even though she knew it was probably gone.

And Leo, making maps, looking in every crack and hole, trying to find something that would make a sad old lady happy.

It was sweet. And probably pointless.

But still sweet.

The next few days passed in a blur of parade preparation, which mostly meant NOT preparing.

We practiced walking on stage—Speedy stopped to smell the porch three times.

We practiced holding our pets up for the judges—Camo fell asleep, Duchess was not visible.

We practiced explaining what made our pets special—we couldn't think of anything that sounded good.

"This is a disaster," Jenna said on Thursday afternoon.

"We knew it would be a disaster," I reminded her.

"I thought it would be a FUNNY disaster. This is just regular disaster."

Ben was examining Camo through the glass of his tank. "He changed color a little today. I think."

We all leaned in to look. Camo was sitting on his branch. Brown. Same brown as always.

"He looks exactly the same," Jenna said.

"The brown is slightly different. Warmer. See?"

I squinted. "I don't see anything."

"It's subtle. You have to really know brown to see it."

"Ben, that's the saddest thing you've ever said."

"Thank you."

I wasn't sure if he was being sarcastic. With Ben, you could never tell.

Friday night, the night before the parade, I couldn't sleep.

I lay in bed and listened to the house settle around me. Dad snoring down the hall. The refrigerator humming in the kitchen. And somewhere outside, a dog barking—not Speedy, she never barked, she just sniffed—some other dog, living some other life.

I thought about the parade. About walking on stage with my slow, three-legged dog who wouldn't do any tricks. About standing next to Ben and his brown chameleon, Jenna and her invisible cat.

We were going to look ridiculous.

And somehow, that felt okay.

I heard footsteps in the hall—Leo, probably getting water. He did that sometimes, wandering around at night, checking on things. Making sure everything was where it should be.

I thought about his map. The star spot. The hiding place he couldn't fit into.

*After the parade*, I'd said. *I promise.*

I'd probably forget. I always forgot Leo's promises. He'd remind me, and I'd say "maybe tomorrow," and eventually he'd stop asking.

That's how it always went.

I turned over and closed my eyes and tried not to think about watches or hiding spots or anything except the parade.

Tomorrow was going to be weird.

But at least we'd be weird together.
