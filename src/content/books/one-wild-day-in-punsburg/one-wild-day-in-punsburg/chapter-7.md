# Breaking Moos

"Good afternoon, Punsburg. I'm Patty Holstein."

"And I'm Chuck Angus."

"And THIS is Channel 5 Cow News—MOO Trust."

The cameras were rolling. The teleprompters were scrolling. Patty and Chuck sat behind the news desk, looking as professional as two Holstein cows could look in matching blazers.

It was 2:00 PM, and they had a LOT to report.

"Chuck, it's been a strange day in Punsburg."

"It certainly has, Patty. Let's start with the clocks."

Patty shuffled her papers. (She didn't have hands, so this involved a lot of nose-nudging.) "At approximately 8:00 AM this morning, every clock in Punsburg jumped forward to noon. Then slowly corrected itself over the next several hours."

"Experts are baffled," Chuck added. "I spoke with the clockmaker on Fifth Street, and he said, and I quote, 'This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen, and I once saw a clock run backwards for an hour.'"

"Any explanation?"

"None yet. But witnesses report seeing three unusual flies near the Miller residence on Maple Street. Could be related. Could be coincidence. Could be..." Chuck paused for effect. "...time flies."

Patty stared at him.

"Moving on," she said. "We've also received multiple reports of a glowing man walking through downtown."

Video footage appeared on screen: Sir Lumen, in full armor, browsing the hardware store.

"The man has been identified as Sir Lumen, owner of the nightlight repair shop on Third Street. He claims he is an actual knight."

"He certainly glows like one," Chuck observed.

"Sir Lumen was seen near the pond earlier today, and witnesses say his reflection created a strange light show on the island. We'll have more on that later."

"In other news," Chuck continued, "parade chaos."

Footage of the Founders' Day Parade appeared. Floats. Marching bands. And then—

"An alpaca," Patty narrated. "Witnesses say this alpaca stormed the parade around 11:00 AM, dragging a suitcase and shouting about llamas."

The alpaca on screen was clearly giving a speech to no one.

"The alpaca was last seen heading toward the city limits but has since been spotted returning to town. Motivation unknown."

"Also," Chuck added, "two cats were seen on rooftops during the parade, apparently communicating through tail movements. Our animal behavior expert says this is—and I quote—'probably fine.'"

Patty nodded. "Cats."

"Indeed."

---

"And now, Patty, the big story."

Patty leaned forward. This was the moment they'd been building toward all broadcast.

"The island."

A graphic appeared: a crude drawing of the pond with the tiny island in the middle. The words "MYSTERIOUS CONVERGENCE?" floated above it.

"We've been receiving reports all day," Patty said. "Strange lights. A feeling of importance. People suddenly remembering appointments they didn't know they had."

"We spoke with Maurice, the famous memory mussel at the Punsburg Aquarium." Chuck pulled up a transcript. "Maurice says something significant is supposed to happen on that island today. But he can't remember what."

"If MAURICE can't remember it," Patty said gravely, "it must be very old. Or very secret. Or both."

"What we DO know: it's connected to today's date. It's connected to the island. And whatever it is, it's happening at sunset."

The cows looked at each other.

"Patty, are we going to the island?"

"Chuck, I believe we are."

---

They wrapped up the broadcast with their standard sign-off.

"This has been Channel 5 Cow News."

"Moo Trust."

"We're Patty and Chuck."

"And we'll see you at the island."

The cameras clicked off. Patty and Chuck removed their blazers (with some difficulty) and headed for the door.

"You really think something big is happening?" Chuck asked.

"Chuck, I've been in news for fifteen years. I've covered the Great Pond Freeze of 2010. I've reported on the time every fire hydrant in town turned into a fountain. I've seen things you wouldn't believe."

"And?"

"And I've never seen a day like today. The clocks. The knight. The alpaca. The cats. It's all connected somehow." She looked toward the pond. "That island is the key."

Chuck nodded solemnly.

"Then let's go be there when it happens."

They walked toward the pond, two professional news cows ready for the story of the century.

Behind them, their newsroom intern—a nervous young calf named Timothy—watched them go. Then he grabbed a camera and ran after them.

Someone had to film this.
