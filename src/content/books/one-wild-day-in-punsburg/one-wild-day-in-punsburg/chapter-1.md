# Time Flies

Saturday morning. 8:00 AM. The best time of the whole week.

Emma Miller sat two inches from the television, watching cartoons in her pajamas. Her cereal was getting soggy. She didn't care. This was the life.

Then she saw the fly.

It was sitting on top of the TV, watching the screen just like she was. When the cartoon character ran, the fly's tiny head followed along.

"Weird," Emma muttered.

She reached for the remote to turn up the volume—and the fly buzzed once, sharply.

Everything stopped.

The cartoon character froze mid-run. The ceiling fan stopped spinning. The clock on the wall went silent. Even the dust floating in the sunlight just... hung there.

Emma held her breath.

Then the fly buzzed twice, and everything started again.

"WHAT," said Emma.

She looked at the fly. The fly looked at her. It had two friends now—three flies total, sitting in a row on top of the television.

Emma reached for the remote again. Very slowly. She pressed the volume button.

*BZZZ.*

Everything stopped.

*BZZZ BZZZ.*

Everything started.

"You're not connected to the remote," Emma whispered. "You're connected to *time*."

The flies didn't answer. They were flies. But one of them did a little loop-de-loop that felt like a "yes."

Emma's brain started working very fast.

"If you can pause time..." she said slowly, "can you rewind it?"

The middle fly—the biggest one—buzzed three times.

The cartoon started playing backwards. The soggy cereal un-sogged. The milk rose up from the bowl and poured itself back into the carton.

"Oh no," said Emma, grinning. "Oh, this is *perfect*."

---

For the next hour, Emma conducted experiments.

Three buzzes: rewind.

Two buzzes: play.

One buzz: pause.

But there was a fourth option. When all three flies buzzed together—one long, continuous sound—time went *fast*.

The cartoon episodes flipped by like pages in a book. The sun tracked across the sky in seconds. The clock hands spun.

Emma laughed and laughed. She could watch the same cartoon forever! She could make boring things zoom past! She could—

Wait.

She looked out the window. The sun was directly overhead now. The shadows were short. And outside, Mrs. Patterson from next door was standing frozen in the middle of watering her garden, looking extremely confused.

Emma had forgotten to keep the time-skipping inside the house.

She'd fast-forwarded the whole neighborhood to noon.

"Oops," said Emma.

Through the window, she could see all sorts of people looking at their watches and scratching their heads. The mail carrier was checking the sun, then his phone, then the sun again. A man walking a dog had stopped completely, baffled.

And—this was strange—there was an alpaca walking down the sidewalk. With a suitcase. The alpaca looked grumpy.

*That's weird*, Emma thought. *Who owns an alpaca in Punsburg?*

But she had bigger problems. She'd broken time for the whole block. Maybe the whole town.

"Okay," she told the flies. "New rule. Indoor time-skipping only."

The flies buzzed in a way that might have been agreement, or might have been laughter.

Emma wasn't sure which was worse.

She looked back out the window. The alpaca had stopped to glare at a lawn gnome. In the distance, she could see the clock tower downtown, and its hands were spinning, trying to catch up with themselves.

"This is fine," Emma told herself. "I'm sure no one will notice."

*BZZZ BZZZ.*

Time played on.
