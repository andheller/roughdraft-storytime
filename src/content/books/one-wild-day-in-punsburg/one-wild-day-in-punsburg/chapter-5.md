# Alpaca My Bags

This was the day. Alejandro had had ENOUGH.

The rooster crowed too early. The hay was too dry. The llamas—don't even get him STARTED on the llamas. They thought they were so special just because they were taller. They weren't. They were just stretched.

"That's it," Alejandro announced to the barn at 7:00 AM. "Alpaca my bags. I'm leaving."

The other animals ignored him. He said this every day.

"I mean it this time!" he insisted.

The goat yawned.

"I have a SUITCASE," Alejandro declared, kicking a battered old suitcase that had been sitting in the corner of the barn for three years. "I am PACKING IT. With my THINGS."

The rooster clucked skeptically.

"You'll see," muttered Alejandro. "You'll ALL see."

By 8:00 AM, Alejandro was on Maple Street, suitcase rolling behind him, looking for the highway out of town.

He passed a house with a kid watching TV inside. The kid waved. Alejandro did not wave back. He was too dramatic for waving.

By 9:00 AM, he was downtown, stuck at a crosswalk.

A man in glowing armor walked past him.

"Nice glow," said Alejandro.

"Thank you," said the knight. "Nice... wool."

"It's called fleece," Alejandro corrected. "And it's magnificent."

They parted ways. Alejandro continued his journey.

By 10:00 AM, he'd passed the aquarium. Through the window, he saw a mussel in a tank. The mussel seemed distressed about something. Alejandro understood. Life was distressing. That's why he was leaving.

He paused to look in the window.

"Don't worry, little mussel," he said. "One day you'll escape too."

The mussel clicked its shell. Alejandro took this as encouragement.

By 11:00 AM, Alejandro was stuck.

A parade. A PARADE. Blocking the entire street.

"UNBELIEVABLE," he shouted.

He tried to cross between floats. He got tangled in streamers. Someone put a sash on him that said "GRAND LLAMA" and he was so offended he couldn't even speak.

"I am NOT a LLAMA!" he finally managed. "I am an ALPACA! There is a DIFFERENCE!"

No one was listening. Someone took a photo of him. A child tried to pet him. Alejandro's eye twitched.

He spotted a float he could climb onto—anything to get across the street. He dragged his suitcase up a ramp and found himself standing in the middle of the parade, surrounded by confused marching band members.

Two cats on nearby rooftops were staring at him.

"WHAT?" he yelled at them. "Haven't you ever seen an alpaca storm a parade before?"

The cats exchanged glances and went back to whatever cat business they were conducting.

By noon, Alejandro had escaped the parade. He was on the outskirts of town now, almost to the city limits. The farm was behind him. A new life was ahead.

He stopped at the WELCOME TO PUNSBURG sign, which faced travelers coming INTO town. From this side, it just said ___GRUBSNUP OT EMOCLEW.

"Goodbye, Punsburg," Alejandro said softly.

And then he didn't move.

The truth was... he'd never actually LEFT before. He'd complained about leaving. He'd threatened to leave. He'd packed and repacked that suitcase dozens of times.

But he'd never walked past that sign.

Beyond it, the road stretched into the unknown. Other towns. Other farms. Other llamas who would probably ALSO think they were better than him.

Alejandro stood there for a long time.

A fly buzzed past—weirdly still, like it was frozen—and then zoomed away.

The sun moved overhead.

And slowly, slowly, Alejandro turned around.

Not because he WANTED to go back. Obviously. He just... realized he'd forgotten something. At the farm. Something important. He'd go get it and THEN leave.

He'd definitely leave.

Eventually.

As he walked back toward town, suitcase bumping behind him, he noticed people heading toward the pond. Quite a lot of people. They seemed excited about something.

"What's happening?" he asked a passing squirrel.

The squirrel chattered something about an island and a sunset.

Alejandro sniffed. He didn't care about islands. He was a sophisticated traveler. A worldly alpaca. He had places to be.

But...

The pond WAS on the way back to the farm. And it had been a long day. And maybe he'd just... stop by. For a minute. To see what all the fuss was about.

"I'm not STAYING," he told the squirrel. "I'm just visiting."

The squirrel was already gone.

Alejandro rolled his suitcase toward the pond.
