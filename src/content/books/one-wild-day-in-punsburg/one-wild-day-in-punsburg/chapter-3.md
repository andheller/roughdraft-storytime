# Mussel Memory

The Punsburg Aquarium was having a confusing morning.

First, all the clocks had gone haywire. They'd jumped straight to noon, then slowly crept back to something more reasonable. The staff was baffled. The fish didn't care.

But Maurice cared.

Maurice was a mussel. Not just any mussel—the *famous* mussel. The star of the Punsburg Aquarium's "Memory Reef" exhibit. The sign above his tank read:

**MAURICE THE MAGNIFICENT**
*The Mussel Who Remembers Everything*

And it was true. Maurice remembered everything. The exact water temperature on the day the aquarium opened in 1987. The name of every fish who had ever lived in Tank 7. The time a kid dropped a corn dog into the shark pool (March 14th, 2019, 2:47 PM).

Maurice was the town's living history book. Schools came from all over to ask him questions. He answered by opening and closing his shell in a special code that only the aquarium staff could translate.

Today, a class of third-graders stood in front of his tank, notebooks ready.

"Ask me anything," said Doris, the aquarium guide, translating for Maurice. "Maurice remembers all."

A girl in the front raised her hand. "When was Punsburg founded?"

*Click-click-click* went Maurice's shell. Doris nodded.

"Maurice says: August 12th, 1847."

"What was the first building?" asked a boy.

*Click-click-click-click.*

"The general store," Doris translated. "On the corner of Main and Maple."

The questions kept coming. Maurice answered them all. What year did the library open? 1902. Who was the first mayor? Harold Pemberton. How many ducks were in the pond on July 4th, 1976? Exactly forty-seven.

Then a small kid in the back asked: "What's special about today?"

Maurice froze.

His shell stopped clicking. The water in his tank went very still.

*Click... click... click?*

Doris frowned. "Maurice says... he doesn't know."

The kids gasped. The famous Maurice, who remembered everything, had forgotten something?

"But there IS something special about today?" the kid pressed.

*Click-click-click-click-click.*

"He says yes," Doris translated slowly. "Something very important. About the town. About... the island? The island in the pond. But he can't remember what."

Maurice sank lower in his tank, embarrassed. A fly buzzed against the glass outside—frozen there, weirdly still—but Maurice was too distressed to notice.

Through the big aquarium windows, a glowing man in armor walked past on the sidewalk. Maurice didn't notice that either.

He was too busy trying to remember.

The school group left. Maurice sat alone in his tank, thinking.

The island. The pond. Something about today. Why couldn't he remember?

He'd lived in Punsburg his whole life—all 127 years of it. Mussels live a long time when they're taken care of. And Maurice had been taken care of very well.

He remembered his first day in this tank. He remembered the old aquarium director, and the one before that, and the one before *that*. He remembered storms and sunny days and the one time a penguin escaped.

But there was a gap. A blank spot. Like something had been erased.

*The island*, he thought. *I know something about that island. I was there. At the very beginning. When Punsburg was just...*

Just what?

He couldn't finish the thought.

Maurice concentrated harder. He flexed his mussel memory—the strongest memory of any shellfish in the tristate area.

A flash. A glimpse.

Lanterns. People gathered. Someone making a speech. The island lit up like—

Gone. The memory slipped away like a minnow.

Maurice clicked his shell in frustration.

*Whatever I forgot*, he thought, *I need to remember it today. Before sunset. I know that much. Something is supposed to happen at the island today, and I'm supposed to know what.*

Through the glass, he could see the pond in the distance. The little island sat there, innocent and ordinary.

But Maurice knew it wasn't ordinary. He just couldn't remember why.

*Maybe if I go there*, he thought. *Maybe if I see it, I'll remember.*

He started planning. Mussels weren't known for their mobility, but Maurice had connections. Friends. A hermit crab who owed him a favor. A very cooperative eel.

He was going to that island.

Even if he had to hitch a ride in someone's portable tank.
