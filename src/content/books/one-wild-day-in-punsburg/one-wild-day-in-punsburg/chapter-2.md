# Knight Light

Sir Lumen had a problem.

It was Saturday morning—9:00 AM by the sun—but every clock in downtown Punsburg said it was noon. The bank clock. The diner clock. The clock tower. All of them: noon.

"Something strange is afoot," said Sir Lumen, stroking his chin.

A woman walking past stopped and stared at him. This happened often. Sir Lumen was a knight. A real one, with armor and everything. He also glowed. Softly, like a nightlight. It was very useful in dark places, but a bit unusual in broad daylight.

"Nice costume," said the woman.

"'Tis not a costume," Sir Lumen replied with dignity. "I am a Knight of the Realm. I run the nightlight repair shop on Third Street."

The woman walked away quickly.

Sir Lumen sighed. Nobody appreciated a good knight anymore.

He trudged back to his shop: SIR LUMEN'S NIGHTLIGHT REPAIR AND RESTORATION. The sign glowed faintly, just like him. He'd been in business for twelve years. If your nightlight flickered, buzzed, or went dark entirely, Sir Lumen was your man. Your knight.

He'd just settled behind the counter when the door burst open.

"Sir Lumen!" cried a small boy. "It's an emergency!"

Sir Lumen leaped to his feet. "A darkness has fallen? A child cannot sleep? A monster lurks in the shadows of a closet?"

"My nightlight broke," said the boy. "Mom says we can't get a new one until next week."

"Unacceptable," declared Sir Lumen. "Let me see it."

The boy handed over a small plastic nightlight shaped like a rocket ship. Sir Lumen examined it carefully. He sniffed it. He held it up to his ear.

"Ah," he said gravely. "The bulb has perished."

"Can you fix it?"

"Indeed. I need only to procure a replacement bulb." Sir Lumen checked his supply cabinet. Empty. "Alas! I am out of stock. I must quest to the hardware store."

"Is that far?"

"Three blocks," said Sir Lumen. "Fraught with peril."

"It's just Third Street."

"FRAUGHT," repeated Sir Lumen, "WITH PERIL."

The quest began.

Sir Lumen marched down Third Street in full armor, his glow gentle in the morning sun. People stared. A dog barked at him. A Channel 5 News van drove past—the side read "COW NEWS: MOO TRUST"—and Sir Lumen could have sworn the driver was an actual cow.

"Strange town," he muttered.

At the corner of Third and Oak, a cat sat in a window, watching him pass. It was orange and very fluffy. Sir Lumen bowed to it. The cat blinked slowly in response.

"A noble creature," Sir Lumen declared.

The hardware store was just ahead. Sir Lumen could see the sign: PUNSBURG HARDWARE. He quickened his pace—

And then he walked past the pond.

The town pond sat in the middle of Punsburg Commons, a small park with benches and ducks. In the middle of the pond was a tiny island. Just a bump of grass and a single tree. Most people ignored it.

But today, Sir Lumen's glow reflected off the water and hit the island. For just a moment, the tree lit up like it was covered in Christmas lights.

"Curious," said Sir Lumen.

He stared at the island. The island did not stare back. It was an island.

But something about it felt... important. Like he should remember something. Like there was an old story about that island that everyone had forgotten.

Sir Lumen shook his head. He had a quest to complete. A child needed a nightlight. There was no time for mysterious islands.

He marched into the hardware store, glow illuminating the aisles.

"One nightlight bulb," he announced. "For a rocket ship of the highest quality."

The teenager at the register didn't even look up from his phone. "Aisle six."

Sir Lumen found the bulb, paid exactly $2.47, and marched back to his shop. The boy was waiting.

"Your rocket ship shall fly again," said Sir Lumen, installing the new bulb with ceremonial precision.

The nightlight glowed to life. The boy's face lit up.

"Thanks, Sir Lumen!"

"Go forth," said the knight. "Sleep well. Fear no darkness."

The boy ran out. Sir Lumen sat back down behind his counter, satisfied.

Through the window, he could see the clock tower. It still said noon.

"Something strange is definitely afoot," he said again.

But that was a mystery for another day. Or possibly later today. Punsburg had a way of getting weird by dinnertime.
