# The Tail of Two Kitties

Whiskers lived on Oak Street.

Biscuit lived on Elm Street.

They were twins—orange and fluffy, born in the same cardboard box behind the grocery store. But when they were adopted, they went to different families on different blocks.

They should have lost touch. Most cats would have.

But Whiskers and Biscuit had invented something special: Tail Language.

From Whiskers' windowsill on Oak Street, she could see Biscuit's windowsill on Elm Street. Just barely. If she squinted. And if Biscuit waved his tail in exactly the right pattern, she could read his messages.

Three swishes left: "Good morning."
Two swishes right: "How's the food?"
One big poof: "URGENT NEWS."

They'd been doing this for three years. Their humans had no idea.

Today was Saturday. 11:00 AM. Time for the morning check-in.

Whiskers hopped onto her windowsill and looked toward Elm Street.

Nothing.

Biscuit's window was blocked. Something huge and colorful was moving slowly down the street between them.

A parade.

"Oh, no," Whiskers meowed.

It was the Punsburg Founders' Day Parade. She'd forgotten. (Cats don't keep calendars.) The whole street was full of floats, marching bands, and people throwing candy.

One float went by with a glowing man in armor standing on it, waving stiffly. *Weird*, thought Whiskers. Another had the high school band playing tubas. A third was covered in—were those actual cows? No, that was just a news van.

But none of that mattered. What mattered was that she couldn't see Biscuit.

And today, of all days, she NEEDED to see Biscuit.

Because she had a message. An urgent one. Her human had said something important at breakfast—something about the island in the pond. The one all the birds were always chirping about. Something was happening there today. At sunset. Something big.

Whiskers had to tell Biscuit. They had to investigate TOGETHER.

---

Biscuit was having the same problem on his end.

He sat at his window, tail twitching with frustration. The parade was ruining everything. He could see the Oak Street rooftops, but not Whiskers' window.

And HE had news too. His human had been on the phone, talking about "the anniversary" and "the island" and "everyone's going to be there."

Going to be WHERE? What anniversary?

He had to tell Whiskers.

Biscuit made a decision. If he couldn't signal through the window, he'd go to her.

He squeezed out through the cat door, darted across the yard, and scrambled up a drainpipe onto the roof.

From up here, the view was different. He could see over the parade. He could see—

Whiskers. On HER roof. Same idea.

Their eyes met across the gap.

Biscuit's tail went crazy. *Big news! The island! Tonight!*

Whiskers' tail answered. *I know! We have to go! Together!*

*How do we get down?*

*I don't know! The parade is blocking everything!*

Between them, a float drifted by. On it, an alpaca was walking in circles, dragging a suitcase and looking very annoyed. The alpaca appeared to be giving a speech to no one in particular.

"That's IT! I've had it! This parade is the final straw!" the alpaca was shouting. "Alpaca my bags for REAL this time!"

Whiskers and Biscuit exchanged glances.

Punsburg was such a weird town.

---

The parade lasted another hour. Whiskers and Biscuit waited on their rooftops, tails twitching with impatience.

Finally, finally, the last float rolled past. The streets cleared. The cats scrambled down their drainpipes and met in the alley between Oak and Elm.

"The island," said Whiskers (in cat).

"Sunset," said Biscuit.

"My human said everyone's going."

"Mine too. Something about a secret anniversary."

They looked at each other, fluffy faces serious.

"We're going too," they said together.

And then, because they were cats, they spent the next twenty minutes chasing a leaf.

But they'd make it to the island. Eventually.

Cats always did things on their own schedule.
