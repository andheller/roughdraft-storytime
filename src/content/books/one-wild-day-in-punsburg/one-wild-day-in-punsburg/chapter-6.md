# Cereal Killer

The crime scene was devastating.

Sofia Martinez stood in front of the open pantry, staring at the evidence. Three empty cereal boxes. Cocoa Puffs: gone. Frosted Flakes: gone. Lucky Charms: nothing but dust and a single dried-out marshmallow.

All that remained was bran flakes.

BRAN. FLAKES.

"This is an outrage," Sofia declared.

It was 1:00 PM on Saturday, and Sofia had just woken up. (She was on summer vacation. Don't judge.) She'd been dreaming about a big bowl of sugary cereal, and instead she'd found... this.

Someone in this house was a cereal killer.

And Sofia was going to find out who.

**SUSPECT #1: Dad**

Sofia found her father in the living room, watching golf.

"Dad," she said. "Did you eat all the good cereal?"

"What? No." He patted his stomach. "I'm on a diet. Ask your mother."

"Mom's at yoga."

"Then ask your brother."

Sofia narrowed her eyes. Dad SAID he was on a diet, but she'd seen him sneak cookies before. She made a mental note: *Possible liar. Needs more investigation.*

**SUSPECT #2: Marcus (brother, age 14, very suspicious)**

Marcus was in his room, playing video games.

"Did you eat all the cereal?" Sofia demanded.

"What? No. I had eggs."

"EGGS?"

"Yeah. I'm trying to get protein for football."

Sofia stared at him. This was new. Since when did Marcus eat eggs? Since when did Marcus care about protein?

"You're too obvious," she said.

"What does that mean?"

"If you WERE the cereal killer, you'd act exactly like this. All innocent."

"I'm not the—Sofia, go away."

She left, but she wasn't convinced. *Too defensive. Classic guilty behavior.*

**SUSPECT #3: Buster (the dog)**

Buster was a golden retriever. He was also asleep in a sunbeam.

Sofia examined him for evidence. No chocolate residue on his snout. No frosted crumbs in his fur. And crucially: no thumbs.

"You're clear," she told him.

Buster wagged his tail without waking up.

**SUSPECT #4: Grandma**

This was the wild card. Grandma had arrived last night for a "surprise visit." She was currently in the kitchen, drinking tea and watching the small TV on the counter.

"Grandma," Sofia said carefully. "Did you... have breakfast this morning?"

"I did! Three bowls of that chocolate cereal. Delicious. I don't know why your mother never buys it."

Sofia's jaw dropped.

"Three bowls?!"

"I was hungry from the drive." Grandma smiled. "Is that a problem?"

On the TV behind her, a cow was reading the news. Sofia was too shocked to notice.

"Grandma," she said slowly. "You ate ALL the good cereal. There's nothing left but bran flakes."

Grandma looked at her blankly. "What's wrong with bran flakes?"

"EVERYTHING, Grandma! EVERYTHING is wrong with bran flakes!"

---

The mystery was solved. But there was no satisfaction in it.

Sofia slumped at the kitchen table, staring at her bowl of bran flakes. She'd added so much sugar it was basically soup. It still tasted like cardboard.

Outside, an ice cream truck went by, its jingle echoing through the neighborhood. It seemed to be going the wrong way down Birch Lane—probably rerouted by something.

Through the window, Sofia saw a glowing man in armor walk past.

She didn't even question it. She was too defeated.

"Grandma," she said. "I need you to take me to the store. We're buying more cereal."

"Can't," said Grandma. "I'm going to the pond. There's something happening at the island."

Sofia looked up. "What?"

"The island in the pond. Everyone's heading there for sunset. Something about a secret anniversary." Grandma was already gathering her things. "It's all over the news. See?"

She pointed at the TV. The cow news anchor was saying something about "Punsburg Pond" and "mysterious convergence" and "don't miss the event of the century."

"Huh," said Sofia.

She'd been so focused on the cereal case that she'd missed whatever was happening in town. Now, with the case closed (and breakfast ruined), maybe she should investigate something else.

"I'm coming with you," Sofia decided.

"Wonderful! Bring the dog."

Buster was already by the door, tail wagging.

Sofia left the bran flakes on the table. Some crimes didn't have happy endings.

But maybe the island would make up for it.
