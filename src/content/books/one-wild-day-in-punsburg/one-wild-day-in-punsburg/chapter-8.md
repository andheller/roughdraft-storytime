# Isle Be There

Sunset. 5:00 PM. The pond.

Something was happening at the island.

Nobody had planned a party. Nobody had sent invitations. Nobody even knew, exactly, why they were here.

And yet, here they all were.

---

Emma Miller arrived first, three flies circling her head like tiny helicopters.

"I don't know why I'm here," she told her mom. "I just felt like I should be."

Her mom was already setting up a picnic blanket. "Me too, honey. Weird, right?"

The flies buzzed in agreement.

---

Sir Lumen arrived in full armor, glowing softly in the fading light.

"I was drawn here," he announced to no one. "The island called to me. My light reflects upon its waters, and I feel... I feel I am meant to witness something."

A kid next to him said, "Cool armor, mister."

"Thank you. I made it myself."

---

Maurice the Mussel arrived in a portable tank, carried by Doris the aquarium guide.

"He insisted," Doris explained to the gathering crowd. "He kept clicking until I agreed to bring him."

Maurice pressed against the glass, watching the island intently. His memory was ALMOST there. ALMOST—

---

Whiskers and Biscuit emerged from under a bush, tails twitching.

They'd spent the afternoon chasing things and napping, but they'd made it. They sat at the edge of the pond, fluffy and dignified.

Between them, in Tail Language:

*We're here.*

*Together.*

*Like always.*

---

Alejandro the Alpaca arrived with his suitcase, looking annoyed.

"I'm not STAYING," he announced to everyone. "I'm just passing through. I'm leaving tomorrow. Probably. Definitely by next week."

Nobody argued with him. They were all too focused on the island.

---

Sofia Martinez arrived with her grandma and Buster the dog.

"So what's happening?" Sofia asked.

"Nobody knows," said an adult.

"Then why is everyone here?"

The adult shrugged. "Felt right."

Sofia looked at the island. It was just a little bump of grass with a tree on it. Nothing special.

And yet.

---

Patty and Chuck arrived with Timothy the intern and his camera.

"We're rolling," Timothy said.

"Good," said Patty. "Whatever happens, we're going to capture it."

"This is history," Chuck agreed.

"Or a weird town tradition we forgot about."

"Same thing, really."

---

The sun touched the horizon.

Sir Lumen's glow caught the water and sent ripples of light toward the island. The tree lit up—just like it had that morning.

And Maurice REMEMBERED.

His shell clicked frantically. Doris translated, shouting over the crowd:

"HE REMEMBERS! Maurice remembers!"

Everyone went quiet.

"Today is August 12th," Doris read. "On this day, 177 years ago, a group of settlers gathered on that island. They lit lanterns. They made speeches. And they founded... Punsburg."

The crowd murmured.

"That island is where the town began. Every year, on this date, the founders celebrated the anniversary. But over time, people forgot. The tradition faded. The island became just... an island."

Maurice clicked again.

"He says he was there. At the very first celebration. He was just a baby mussel then, in a settler's bucket of drinking water. He watched the whole thing."

Silence.

Then someone in the crowd said: "So today is Punsburg's birthday?"

"That's right," said Doris. "And Maurice is the only one who remembered—even though he forgot he remembered."

---

For a moment, nobody moved.

Then Emma's mom pulled out a bag of chips. "Well, I brought snacks."

Someone else had a radio. Music started playing.

Grandma Martinez sat down on a bench. "I brought cookies. Who wants cookies?"

Sir Lumen raised his arm, and his glow intensified. "LET THERE BE LIGHT!"

The island lit up like a stage.

And just like that—without anyone planning it—the party started.

---

The sun set. The stars came out. The island glowed.

Emma let her flies loose, and they buzzed around the pond, flickering the lights in playful patterns—not stopping time, just adding to the show.

Sir Lumen posed for photos. He was very good at posing.

Maurice floated contentedly in his tank, clicking softly. He'd finally remembered. The weight of 177 years lifted off his tiny mussel shoulders.

Whiskers and Biscuit sat together, watching the humans celebrate. They didn't fully understand what was happening, but they knew it was good.

Alejandro the Alpaca was eating grass near the pond and pretending he wasn't enjoying himself. His suitcase sat unopened beside him.

Sofia shared her grandma's cookies with everyone. Buster got extra pets from strangers.

Patty and Chuck reported live from the scene. Timothy filmed everything. This was the story of their careers.

---

As the night went on, people started telling stories.

Stories about Punsburg. About the weird clock incident that morning. About the knight they'd seen walking downtown. About an alpaca in the parade.

And slowly, piece by piece, they realized:

Today had been connected all along.

The time flies had made everyone notice that something was off. Sir Lumen's light had reflected the magic of the island. Maurice's forgotten memory had given them a reason to gather. The cats had spread the word through the neighborhood. The alpaca had—well, he'd been very dramatic, and drama was part of any good celebration. Sofia had solved a smaller mystery, which had led her here. And the cow news had told everyone where to be.

One chaotic day. Eight weird stories.

All leading to the same island at sunset.

"Same time next year?" someone asked.

Everyone groaned.

But also, everyone nodded.

---

The party went late. By the time people started heading home, the moon was high and the island was quiet again.

Maurice was the last to leave. Doris carried his tank slowly, letting him take one final look.

*I won't forget this time*, he thought. *I'll remember this for another 177 years.*

Across the pond, Alejandro picked up his suitcase.

"I'm leaving tomorrow," he said. But he was smiling now.

Maybe next year, he'd be back.

Maybe they all would.

**THE END**

*(For now.)*

*(See you next August 12th.)*
