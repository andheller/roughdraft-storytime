# The Journey

I should tell you something important: this chapter took the longest to reconstruct.

The sources become fragmentary here—scattered notes, half-finished journal entries, one truly unhelpful map that appears to have been drawn by a child (or possibly an adult with no artistic ability). What follows is my best attempt at piecing together events that even the participants themselves seem to have found confusing.

What I know for certain: Rosalind and Edmund both attempted to access their kingdoms' Royal Vaults. Both failed. Both decided to try something more drastic.

What I am less certain about: almost everything else.

Let's begin.

---

Rosalind's attempt to enter the Easthollow Royal Vault lasted exactly fourteen minutes.

The vault was located beneath the castle, guarded by two soldiers, three locked doors, and one extremely suspicious archivist who had been protecting old documents since before Rosalind was born.

"I need to see the pre-war records," Rosalind announced, trying to sound authoritative.

"No," said the archivist.

"I'm a princess."

"You're the SEVENTH princess. Come back when you're first, second, or at least top five."

"But it's important—"

"Everything is important to someone. These documents are important to HISTORY. And history says you can't come in without written authorization from the Queen, the Keeper of Records, AND a note from your governess."

"My governess?"

"Proves you've done your lessons. Can't have uneducated people touching delicate materials."

Rosalind retreated to consider her options.

---

Meanwhile, in Westmarch, Edmund was having similar problems.

"I need to see the pre-war records," Edmund announced, also trying to sound authoritative.

"No," said the Westmarch archivist, who was apparently a universal type.

"I'm a prince."

"You're the FIFTH prince. Come back when you matter."

"But—"

"Next!"

There was no one behind him. The archivist was just being dramatic.

---

They compared notes via pigeon. (Gerald arrived four days late, covered in mud, with the message partly eaten. The essential information survived.)

*Can't get in,* Edmund wrote. *Archivists are the worst.*

*Same here,* Rosalind replied. *We need another plan.*

The new plan was simple, foolish, and inevitable: if they couldn't access the records through official channels, they would access them through unofficial ones.

They would break into the vaults.

At night.

Simultaneously.

"This is a terrible idea," Edmund muttered to himself as he studied the castle blueprints he'd... borrowed from the engineering office.

"This is a terrible idea," Rosalind muttered to herself as she practiced picking locks on her bedroom door.

They proceeded anyway, because terrible ideas are often the only ideas available when you're twelve years old and trying to end a three-hundred-year war.

---

The night of the vault expeditions—which occurred simultaneously in both kingdoms, on the same moonless night, because they'd coordinated via pigeon (a minor miracle of timing)—was later called "The Night of Historical Theft" by absolutely no one, because nobody knew it happened except the participants.

I present the events in parallel, reconstructed from journal entries written after the fact.

**Rosalind's Version:**

*10 PM: Snuck out of chambers. Used the old servants' passage behind the tapestry. Nobody uses that passage anymore because it's full of spiders. I do not like spiders. But I like war even less.*

*10:30 PM: Reached the vault entrance. Guards were playing cards. Waited for them to get distracted by an argument about cheating (one guard definitely cheated).*

*10:47 PM: Picked the first lock. (Thank you, book on "Mechanical Curiosities" that I found in the library.)*

*10:52 PM: Picked the second lock. Hands shaking. This is treason. Actual treason. Not petty treason. REGULAR treason.*

*11:15 PM: Third lock is HARDER. Who designed this? Someone who hates future princesses, that's who.*

*11:34 PM: INSIDE. The vault smells like dust and old paper and disappointment. Began searching for pre-war documents.*

*11:47 PM: Found the section. Everything is labeled "CLASSIFIED - AUTUMNAL INCIDENT." Grabbed everything I could carry.*

*12:03 AM: Heard footsteps. Hid behind a shelf. Archivist came in to check on something. Did not look behind the shelf. My heart was beating so loud I thought he'd hear it.*

*12:15 AM: Archivist left. Escaped via the same route. Did not encounter spiders this time. Small miracle.*

*12:45 AM: Back in chambers. Shaking. Cannot believe that worked.*

**Edmund's Version:**

*10 PM: Left my rooms. Told the guard I was going to the library. Guards don't care about the library. Nobody cares about the library except me.*

*10:20 PM: Reached the vault through the old drainage tunnels. They're dry now but they still smell like the sixteenth century.*

*10:35 PM: Only one guard tonight. He was ASLEEP. This kingdom's security is embarrassing.*

*10:40 PM: Locks were easier than expected. I think nobody's changed them in a hundred years.*

*11:00 PM: Inside the vault. It's organized. I'm impressed. Started looking for pre-war materials.*

*11:22 PM: Found a section labeled "DO NOT OPEN - HISTORICAL EMBARRASSMENTS." This is definitely it.*

*11:30 PM: Found the original pudding recipe. It's here. It's REAL. There are notes in the margins. Someone wrote: "This was a mistake."*

*11:45 PM: Also found a letter. A formal apology from King Bartholomew to King Archibald. It was never sent. Someone wrote "BURN THIS" on it, but they never did.*

*12:00 AM: Left the vault. Guard still asleep. Made it back to my rooms without being seen.*

*12:15 AM: I have the evidence. Real evidence. Now what do we do with it?*

---

They met again at the bridge three days later. This time, they brought their findings.

"Look at this," Edmund said, spreading the unsent apology letter on the stone railing. "King Bartholomew tried to apologize. He wrote: 'We deeply regret any offense caused by the ceremonial pudding. It was meant to honor Your Majesty, not to insult you. The dessert's resemblance to your noble countenance was intended as a tribute.'"

"He called it a TRIBUTE," Rosalind said flatly.

"He was trying!"

"Look at this." Rosalind pulled out a document from her pile. "It's a letter from King Archibald's advisor to our ministers. It says: 'His Majesty was prepared to overlook the pudding incident until he observed the Westmarch court LAUGHING while consuming the dessert. This was taken as deliberate mockery.'"

"They laughed?"

"Apparently the pudding was DELICIOUS. People were enjoying it. King Archibald thought they were laughing at HIM."

Edmund rubbed his forehead. "So the war started because people were happy eating a good dessert."

"And because nobody explained what was happening."

"And because the apology was never sent."

"Someone wrote 'burn this' and then DIDN'T burn it. Why?"

Edmund looked at the letter. "Pride? Stubbornness? By the time someone might have sent it, maybe too much had already happened?"

"Three hundred years of too much," Rosalind agreed.

Gerald cooed from his perch on the bridge railing. He had somehow arrived BEFORE them this time, which was unprecedented.

"So we have the evidence," Edmund said. "We have the original recipe, the unsent apology, the advisor's letter, all the documentation. What now?"

Rosalind had been thinking about this. "We need to show everyone at once. Both kingdoms. If we show just one side, they can deny it, call it enemy propaganda. But if both kingdoms see the evidence at the same time, from sources inside their OWN archives..."

"A simultaneous revelation."

"Exactly."

"How do we do that?"

Rosalind smiled. It was not a reassuring smile. It was the smile of someone who had just had an idea that was either brilliant or disastrous.

"The Harvest Festival," she said. "It's in two weeks. Both kingdoms celebrate it on the same day. There will be public gatherings, speeches, everyone in one place."

"You want to disrupt the Harvest Festival."

"I want to use the Harvest Festival. We each present the evidence in our own kingdom, at the same time, in front of as many people as possible."

"That's... that's extremely public."

"That's the point. If we do it privately, it can be suppressed. If we do it publicly, everyone knows. They can't pretend they didn't hear it."

Edmund thought about this. His father would be furious. His brothers would be embarrassed. The entire kingdom would have to confront the fact that they'd been fighting for three centuries over a dessert.

"They'll hate us," he said quietly.

"Maybe. Or maybe they'll finally be free to stop fighting." Rosalind met his eyes. "Are you with me?"

Edmund looked at the evidence spread before them. The recipe for the Triumphant Pudding. The unsent apology. The letter describing a king's wounded pride. All of it ridiculous. All of it real.

"I'm with you," he said.

They shook hands again, less awkwardly this time.

"Two weeks," Rosalind said. "We prepare our presentations, gather our courage, and change history."

"Or get arrested for treason."

"One or the other. Possibly both."

Gerald cooed in what might have been encouragement.

They walked back to their respective kingdoms, carrying evidence of the most pointless war in history.

Behind them, the bridge stood empty, waiting for whatever came next.
