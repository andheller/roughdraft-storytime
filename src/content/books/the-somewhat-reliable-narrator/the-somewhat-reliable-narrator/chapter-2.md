# Correspondence

Over the following weeks, the letters flew back and forth across the border with remarkable frequency. Gerald, despite his directional challenges, somehow managed to deliver most of them—though the route he took was never the same twice and occasionally involved detours through neighboring kingdoms that had nothing to do with anything.

I have, through considerable effort, obtained copies of several of these letters. They make for interesting reading, though I should note that some portions are illegible due to water damage, pigeon-related incidents, and what appears to be jam.

I present them here, lightly edited for clarity.

*Letter 4*
*FROM: Someone Who Asks Questions*
*TO: Someone Else Who Asks Questions*

*I found something! In the Royal Library, there's a section called "Pre-Conflict Archives." It's in the basement. It smells like mold and everyone's forgotten about it.*

*Most of the documents are boring—grain reports, livestock counts, very detailed arguments about fence placement. But I found a reference to "The Incident of the Autumnal Delegation." It says: "Following the events of the delegation, relations between the kingdoms were IRREPARABLY DAMAGED."*

*What delegation? What events? IRREPARABLY DAMAGED HOW?*

*The next three pages are missing. Torn out. On purpose, I think.*

*Someone is hiding something.*

*Did you find anything on your end?*

*- Questions*

---

*Letter 5*
*FROM: Someone Else*
*TO: Questions*

*I did! In our archives, there's a folder labeled "NEVER SPEAK OF THIS" (which is, honestly, a terrible way to keep a secret—it makes people want to speak of it immediately).*

*The folder contains a single document: a guest list for a diplomatic banquet, dated about three hundred years ago. The banquet was hosted by Westmarch to welcome a delegation from Easthollow.*

*The guest list includes names from both kingdoms. At the bottom, someone has scrawled: "DISASTER. SEE SUBSEQUENT REPORT."*

*There is no subsequent report. I looked everywhere.*

*But I noticed something strange. The banquet was held in the autumn. Your "Autumnal Delegation" must be the same event.*

*Something happened at that banquet. Something that started a war that's lasted three hundred years.*

*WHAT WAS IT?*

*- Else*

---

*Letter 7*
*FROM: Questions*
*TO: Else*

*I asked my mother (the Queen) (I should mention that I'm a princess, I think I forgot to mention that) about the Autumnal Delegation.*

*She got very quiet and changed the subject.*

*When I pressed, she said: "Some things are better left in the past, Rosalind."*

*Then she realized she'd used my name and looked horrified. She told me to stop asking dangerous questions and go do something appropriate for a princess, like embroidery or fainting.*

*I don't embroider and I've never fainted in my life.*

*Anyway, now I'm even more curious. What could possibly be so terrible that it started a three-hundred-year war AND nobody wants to talk about it?*

*Do you think it was murder? It was probably murder. These things usually are.*

*- Rosalind (apparently we're using real names now)*

*P.S. - My pigeon (Gerald) is getting better at directions. He only went south once this time.*

*Letter 8*
*FROM: Else*
*TO: Rosalind*

*My name is Edmund. I'm a prince, which I also forgot to mention. Fifth in line to the throne, which means I'm basically irrelevant to everyone except tutors who think I should be learning something useful.*

*I don't think it was murder. Murder would be in the official histories. Murder is dramatic—people like to write about it. Whatever happened at that banquet was embarrassing enough that everyone agreed to pretend it didn't exist.*

*I found another document. A receipt for a delivery to the royal kitchens the day before the banquet. The receipt lists: seventeen barrels of wine, forty wheels of cheese, two hundred loaves of bread, and (this is the interesting part) "one item, SPECIAL ORDER, DO NOT DISCUSS."*

*What was the special order? Why couldn't they discuss it?*

*I'm going to search the kitchen archives next. If they still exist.*

*- Edmund*

*P.S. - Your pigeon arrived covered in what I think is honey. I'm not going to ask.*

*Letter 11*
*FROM: Rosalind*
*TO: Edmund*

*The kitchen archives! I didn't think of that!*

*I looked in ours. Most of the old records were thrown out years ago, but I found one ledger that survived because someone was using it to prop up a wobbly table in the pantry.*

*The ledger includes menus from three hundred years ago. The Autumnal Delegation banquet menu is there. Most of it is normal—roast meats, vegetables, fourteen kinds of pie (we really liked pie apparently).*

*But at the bottom, there's a handwritten note: "The Pie was not our fault. The recipe was provided BY THE GUESTS."*

*Guests meaning Westmarch. Your kingdom.*

*WHAT PIE? What was wrong with the pie?*

*- Rosalind*

*P.S. - I'm starting to think this whole war might be about food. Which would be incredibly stupid. But also believable.*

*Letter 14*
*FROM: Edmund*
*TO: Rosalind*

*I found something.*

*Hidden in the back of a storage closet, behind seventeen years of tax records that nobody has ever looked at, there's a small locked box. I picked the lock (princes learn surprising skills when they're bored enough).*

*Inside the box was a single page. It's damaged—burned at the edges, water-stained—but I could make out most of it.*

*It's a recipe. For something called "The Triumphant Pudding."*

*The note at the bottom says: "Do NOT serve to Easthollow. Under ANY circumstances. By order of King Bartholomew."*

*King Bartholomew was king three hundred years ago. Right when the war started.*

*Someone served Easthollow a pudding they weren't supposed to have.*

*Is THAT what started the war? A PUDDING?*

*- Edmund*

*P.S. - If this is true, I'm going to be very annoyed.*

---

*Letter 15*
*FROM: Rosalind*
*TO: Edmund*

*It's a pudding.*

*IT'S A PUDDING.*

*I found confirmation. There's an old painting in our castle's back hallway—everyone thought it was just a weird portrait of our ancestor looking angry. But I looked closer at the background, and there's a table, and on the table is a PUDDING, and underneath someone has painted (very small) the words: "NEVER FORGET."*

*Our ancestors went to war over a PUDDING.*

*I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Three hundred years. Thousands of soldiers. Countless resources. All because someone served a dessert that offended someone.*

*We need to tell people. We need to show them how ridiculous this is.*

*Meet me at the border. The old stone bridge at Midway Creek. I don't care if it's dangerous. I don't care if it's against the rules. This is too important.*

*One week from today. Noon.*

*Bring everything you've found.*

*- Rosalind*

*P.S. - I'm bringing Gerald. He got us into this; he should see how it ends.*

Now, I should pause here to acknowledge something: these letters suggest a rather dramatic meeting at the border. The sources agree that such a meeting occurred. They do NOT agree on most of the details.

One account says it was raining. Another says it was beautiful and sunny. A third claims there was a minor earthquake, but I suspect that chronicler was being metaphorical.

What we know for certain is this: two young people, from two kingdoms at war, decided to meet face-to-face to share what they'd learned.

This was, by any reasonable standard, an extremely foolish thing to do.

It was also, as it turned out, exactly what needed to happen.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. The meeting comes next chapter. For now, let us simply note that sometimes the most important moments in history begin with nothing more than a series of letters, a confused pigeon, and the simple question: WHY?
