# A Note About Sources

Before we begin, I should be honest with you.

I wasn't there when any of this happened. Not in the castle, not at the border, not in the pigeon coop. I'm piecing this story together from a variety of sources: three official histories (which disagree on almost everything), seventeen personal letters (most of which are water-damaged), one diary entry that may or may not be a forgery, and a tavern song that rhymes "war" with "more" and "door" approximately seventy-four times.

I've done my best to assemble something resembling the truth. I make no promises about accuracy. When I'm uncertain, I'll say so. When the sources contradict each other, I'll pick the version that makes the better story.

This seems only fair.

Now then.

The Kingdom of Westmarch and the Kingdom of Easthollow had been at war for so long that no one alive could remember why.

This was not an exaggeration. Scholars had searched the royal archives. Historians had interviewed the oldest citizens. The Royal War Museum of Easthollow had an entire wing dedicated to "Origins of the Conflict," which contained approximately three hundred artifacts and zero explanations.

The war had simply always been happening, like weather or taxes.

"Why ARE we at war with Easthollow?" Prince Edmund of Westmarch once asked his father, King Harold the Adequate.

(I should note that King Harold earned his epithet not because he was particularly inadequate, but because a previous chronicler couldn't spell "Augustus" and the mistake was never corrected. This is, apparently, how history works.)

"They started it," King Harold replied, which was his standard answer to all questions about the war.

"But how? What did they do?"

"Something terrible, I'm sure." The king waved his hand vaguely. "Ask the War Council. They'll know."

The War Council did not, in fact, know. Neither did the Royal Historians, the Ministry of Grievances, or the Keeper of Ancient Grudges (a real position, apparently, though the current Keeper admitted he mostly just organized old scrolls and tried to look important).

The war continued anyway.

In Easthollow, the situation was remarkably similar. Queen Mathilda the Stern (who was actually quite cheerful in private but felt that monarchs should look imposing in portraits) held regular strategy meetings about a conflict she couldn't explain.

"Why ARE we at war with Westmarch?" Princess Rosalind once asked, interrupting such a meeting.

"They started it," Queen Mathilda replied.

"Everyone says that. Both sides say that."

"Well, someone must have started it."

"But WHO?"

Queen Mathilda looked uncomfortable. The War Council looked uncomfortable. The Royal Historian pretended to study a very interesting spot on the ceiling.

"These things are complicated, dear," the queen said finally. "Now please go practice your embroidery or something. The adults are busy."

Rosalind did not go practice embroidery. Rosalind went to the pigeon coop, because that was where she always went when adults were being useless.

The pigeon coop was her sanctuary. It sat at the top of the eastern tower, far from tutors and etiquette lessons and her six older sisters, who had opinions about everything and shared them constantly. The pigeons didn't have opinions. The pigeons just cooed and ate seed and occasionally delivered messages to the wrong destinations.

The most reliable messenger pigeon was named Gerald, though "reliable" was perhaps not the right word. Gerald had a strong sense of direction in the way that some people have a strong sense of fashion—meaning he was confident about it but frequently wrong. He had once delivered a birthday invitation to a enemy general, a love letter to a bakery, and a declaration of truce to a confused shepherd in the mountains.

But he was Rosalind's favorite, because he tried so hard.

"Hello, Gerald," Rosalind said, climbing into the coop and settling onto her usual perch. "Anything interesting today?"

Gerald cooed.

"That's what I thought."

She pulled out her sketchbook—not for embroidery, but for maps. Rosalind loved maps. She loved the idea that you could draw a line between two places and suddenly they were connected, even if everyone said they were enemies. On her best map, the border between Westmarch and Easthollow was marked with a dotted line and a small note: SEEMS ARBITRARY.

She was adding details to the Westmarch mountains when she heard a flutter of wings. A pigeon had arrived—not one of hers, but a stranger, looking tired and confused.

"Wrong coop, friend," she told it. "This is Easthollow. Where are you trying to go?"

The pigeon, naturally, said nothing. But there was a tiny scroll tied to its leg, and when Rosalind untied it, she found a message:

*TO: The Royal Archives of Easthollow*
*FROM: The Ministry of Historical Records, Westmarch*
*RE: Formal Request for Pre-War Documentation*

*We are conducting a comprehensive survey of historical records pertaining to the Origin of the Current Conflict. If your archives contain any documents dated prior to the Initiation of Hostilities (date unknown), please forward copies at your earliest convenience.*

*We are particularly interested in any evidence that Easthollow started it.*

*Regards,*
*The Ministry of Historical Records*

Rosalind read it twice.

Then she laughed so hard that several pigeons flew away in alarm.

"They don't know either," she said to Gerald. "THEY DON'T KNOW EITHER!"

This changed things. If neither side knew why the war had started, then maybe—just maybe—it could be ended. Someone just had to be sensible about it.

She looked at the message again. It had been sent from the Ministry of Historical Records in Westmarch. Someone there was asking questions. Someone there was trying to figure things out.

Someone, she thought, who might be worth talking to.

She pulled out a fresh piece of paper and began to write:

*TO: The Ministry of Historical Records, Westmarch*
*FROM: A Concerned Citizen of Easthollow*

*I received your message by accident (I think your pigeon is lost) (they get that way sometimes) (it's the mountains, probably). I don't have access to the Royal Archives, but I've been wondering the same thing you're wondering: WHY IS THERE A WAR?*

*Nobody here knows either. I've asked. Everyone just says "they started it" and changes the subject.*

*Maybe we could figure it out together? Share information?*

*I realize this might be treason. I'm not sure. The laws about corresponding with the enemy are confusing. But the whole WAR is confusing, so I figure one more confusing thing won't hurt.*

*If you write back, please use a smarter pigeon. This one looks like it's been flying in circles.*

*Sincerely,*
*Someone Who Asks Questions*

She tied the note to Gerald's leg. He was, admittedly, not a smart pigeon. But he was HER pigeon, and she trusted him.

"Find the Ministry of Historical Records," she told him. "In Westmarch. That's the kingdom to the WEST. Do you understand? WEST."

Gerald cooed confidently.

He flew east.

"Gerald, NO—"

But he was already gone, disappearing into the evening sky, heading in completely the wrong direction.

Rosalind sighed.

The message would either arrive at its destination or it wouldn't. Either someone would write back or they wouldn't. Either something would change or everything would stay exactly the same.

She went back to her map, adding a small arrow pointing west and labeling it: THIS WAY TO ANSWERS. PROBABLY.

---

Now, you might be wondering: how did the message actually reach Westmarch, given that Gerald flew east?

The honest answer is: I have no idea.

The sources are unclear. One account suggests that Gerald got turned around by a storm and ended up going the right direction by accident. Another claims he landed on a merchant ship that happened to be sailing west. A third, rather implausible version involves a series of other pigeons passing the message along like a very slow and feathery postal service.

What matters is that three days later, the message arrived.

It landed on the desk of a young man who worked in the Ministry of Historical Records and who spent most of his time being ignored by adults.

His name was Edmund.

He was a prince, though he tried not to mention this at work. Princes were supposed to be learning sword fighting and diplomacy, not cataloging old documents. But Edmund had discovered that if you looked busy enough and kept your head down, adults mostly forgot you existed.

He opened the scroll, read it, and sat very still for a long moment.

Someone on the other side was asking the same questions he was asking.

Someone on the other side didn't know either.

He pulled out a fresh piece of paper and began to write.

*TO: Someone Who Asks Questions*
*FROM: Someone Else Who Asks Questions*

*I got your message. I don't know how—the pigeon looked exhausted and confused and possibly traumatized. I gave it some bread and water. It's sleeping now.*

*You're right. We don't know why the war started either. I've searched three hundred years of records and found exactly nothing useful. Just a lot of "CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT READ" stamps on empty folders.*

*I want to know the truth. I suspect the truth might be embarrassing for someone, which is why it's so hard to find.*

*Write back if you can. Use a different pigeon if possible.*

*Sincerely,*
*Someone Else*

He tied the message to a ministry pigeon—a sensible, well-trained bird who actually knew which way was west—and sent it flying.

And so began a correspondence that would, eventually, change everything.

But that part comes later.

For now, two young people in two enemy kingdoms had discovered something remarkable: they were not the only ones asking questions.

That, as it turned out, was a very good place to start.
