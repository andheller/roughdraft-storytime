# The Realization

The old stone bridge at Midway Creek had been built three hundred and fifty years ago, during a brief period when Westmarch and Easthollow had been allies. It was meant to be a symbol of friendship—a place where travelers from both kingdoms could meet and trade and share news.

That was before the war.

Now the bridge was abandoned, overgrown with vines, and technically off-limits to citizens of both kingdoms. Signs on each end warned: BORDER CROSSING FORBIDDEN. VIOLATORS WILL BE DEALT WITH.

(The signs did not specify what "dealt with" meant. This was intentional. It sounded more threatening that way.)

Rosalind arrived first.

She had snuck out at dawn, telling her sisters she was going for a ride, which was technically true. She'd ridden to a farmhouse two miles from the border, left her horse with a confused farmer who owed her a favor, and walked the rest of the way through the woods.

Gerald was in a small cage strapped to her back. He cooed occasionally, in what she hoped was encouragement.

The bridge looked exactly as she'd imagined: old, forgotten, and vaguely romantic in a crumbling sort of way. She sat on the Easthollow side and waited.

She was nervous. This was, objectively, a bad idea. Meeting a stranger from an enemy kingdom, based entirely on letters delivered by an unreliable pigeon, could go wrong in approximately seven hundred ways. He could be lying about who he was. He could be a spy. He could have brought soldiers.

But he could also be exactly who he said he was: a curious boy who wanted to understand why his kingdom was fighting a war nobody could explain.

Rosalind was betting on the second option. She was usually right about people.

Edmund appeared at noon, exactly as promised. He came from the Westmarch side, walking carefully through the overgrown path, carrying a leather satchel that presumably contained his documents. He was shorter than she'd expected—about her height—with dark hair and an expression of nervous determination.

They stared at each other across the bridge.

"You're real," Edmund said, sounding relieved. "I was worried you might be a very sophisticated military trap."

"I was worried you might be a very sophisticated military trap," Rosalind admitted. "I'm glad we're both just... people."

"People who are technically committing treason."

"Minor treason. Petty treason. Is there such a thing as petty treason?"

"I don't think so. Treason is usually just... treason."

They stood in awkward silence for a moment.

"Should we meet in the middle?" Rosalind suggested. "Symbolically, I mean. Neutral ground."

"That seems appropriate."

They walked toward each other, meeting at the exact center of the bridge. Up close, Edmund looked tired—like someone who had been staying up late reading old documents and not sleeping enough. Rosalind probably looked the same.

"So," Edmund said. "A pudding."

"A pudding," Rosalind agreed. "Three hundred years of war. Thousands of deaths. Entire generations growing up hating each other. All because of a PUDDING."

"When you put it like that, it sounds ridiculous."

"It IS ridiculous. It was always ridiculous. The question is: what do we do about it?"

Edmund opened his satchel and pulled out the documents he'd collected. Rosalind did the same. They spread everything on the bridge's stone railing and began comparing notes.

"Here's what I've pieced together," Edmund said. "Three hundred years ago, Easthollow sent a diplomatic delegation to Westmarch. Everything was going well. Then, at the banquet, someone served a dessert called 'The Triumphant Pudding.'"

"Which was apparently offensive somehow."

"Very offensive. The Easthollow delegation left in the middle of the meal. By the next morning, both kingdoms had declared war."

Rosalind frowned at the recipe he'd found. "But why was it offensive? It's just a pudding. Sugar, cream, eggs, some kind of fruit preserve..."

"I don't know. There's nothing inherently insulting about the ingredients."

"Unless..." Rosalind pulled out the painting detail she'd sketched. "Look at this. The pudding in the painting—what shape is it?"

Edmund squinted. "Round, I think? With some kind of design on top?"

"It looks like it might be molded. Shaped like something. See these lines here?"

They both stared at it.

"Is that... a face?" Edmund asked slowly.

"I think it might be a face. A very lumpy, pudding-shaped face."

"Whose face?"

Rosalind's eyes went wide. "Oh no."

"What?"

"The Easthollow delegation three hundred years ago—it was led by King Archibald the Proud. He was famous for his enormous beard and his even more enormous ego. If someone made a pudding that was shaped like his face..."

"And then everyone ATE it..."

"In front of him..."

They looked at each other.

"They ate the king's face," Edmund said flatly. "They served a face-shaped pudding of the visiting king and then ate it while he watched."

"It would have been meant as an HONOR. 'Look, we made a pudding that looks like you! You're so important!' But if someone didn't explain that..."

"Or if someone DID explain it badly..."

"Or if King Archibald was already in a bad mood..."

"Which, given that his epithet was 'the Proud,' seems likely..."

Rosalind sat down heavily on the bridge railing. "This is worse than I thought."

"How is this WORSE? It's absurd! The whole thing is completely absurd!"

"That's why it's worse!" Rosalind waved her hands in frustration. "If the war had been started by something real—a murder, a betrayal, a genuine conflict of interests—then people might accept that it was time to end it. But THIS? If people find out the war started because of a PUDDING MISUNDERSTANDING, they'll be mortified. Humiliated. Three hundred years of pride and sacrifice and national identity, all based on a DESSERT."

Edmund was quiet for a moment. "You think they won't want to know the truth."

"I think they'll HATE the truth. It makes everyone look stupid. It makes the whole war look pointless."

"The war IS pointless."

"WE know that. But our parents, our generals, everyone who's ever lost someone in this conflict—they've been telling themselves it means something. That their sacrifices were for a reason. If we prove the reason was a pudding that looked like a king's face..."

Edmund sat down next to her. Gerald cooed softly in his cage.

"So what do we do?" Edmund asked. "Give up? Pretend we never found out?"

"I don't want to give up." Rosalind stared at the creek flowing beneath them. "I just... I don't know how to make people accept something this embarrassing."

"Maybe we don't have to make them accept it. Maybe we just have to make them look at it."

"What do you mean?"

"Right now, nobody talks about the war's origin. It's all 'they started it' and changed subjects. What if we force the conversation? What if we get the evidence in front of so many people that they CAN'T ignore it?"

Rosalind considered this. "That would require getting into both kingdoms' official archives. Gathering undeniable proof. And then somehow presenting it publicly."

"Sounds impossible."

"It sounds extremely difficult. There's a difference."

Gerald cooed again.

Rosalind looked at her pigeon—the confused, directionally-challenged bird who had somehow managed to connect two strangers across enemy lines. If Gerald could do the impossible, maybe they could too.

"We need more evidence," she said finally. "What we have is suggestive, but not conclusive. If we're going to convince anyone, we need the actual recipe, the actual records, something that proves beyond doubt what happened."

"The recipe I found was from Westmarch. Do you have Easthollow's version?"

"I have references to it, but not the actual document. It might be in the Royal Vault—the secure archive where they keep the most sensitive historical materials."

"We have a Royal Vault too."

"Then we each need to find a way into our kingdom's vault." Rosalind stood up, suddenly energized. "We get the original documents. We compare them. We build an irrefutable case. And then we figure out how to present it."

"This sounds like it could take months."

"Probably. Are you willing to keep going?"

Edmund looked at her—this princess from an enemy kingdom, standing on a forbidden bridge, proposing they continue their treasonous investigation.

"I've got nothing better to do," he said. "Fifth in line to the throne, remember? Nobody expects anything from me. Might as well use that for something worthwhile."

Rosalind smiled. "Partners, then?"

"Partners." He shook her hand formally, then immediately felt silly about it. "Should we... schedule another meeting? Or just keep using the pigeons?"

"Pigeons for now. Gerald is unreliable, but he's getting better." She glanced at the cage, where Gerald was attempting to eat a small stick. "Mostly better."

"I'll send my pigeon if I find anything important."

"I'll do the same."

They gathered their documents and prepared to leave, heading back to their respective kingdoms.

"Rosalind?" Edmund called, just before she disappeared into the Easthollow woods.

She turned. "Yes?"

"Thank you. For writing back. For not thinking I was crazy."

"You're not crazy. You're just asking questions. There's nothing crazy about questions."

"Tell that to my father."

"Maybe someday I will." She smiled. "Good luck with the vault."

"Good luck with yours."

And then she was gone, and Edmund was alone on the bridge, holding a collection of documents about a pudding that had started a war.

Gerald cooed from somewhere in the distance, already flying the wrong direction.

Some things, Edmund reflected, never changed.

But some things could. With enough evidence, enough courage, and enough confused pigeons.

He started walking home.

The real work was about to begin.
