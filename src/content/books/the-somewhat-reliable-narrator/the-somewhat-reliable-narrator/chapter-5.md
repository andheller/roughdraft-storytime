# The Investigation

I need to pause here and admit something uncomfortable: I don't know exactly what happened in the two weeks between the bridge meeting and the Harvest Festival.

My sources become remarkably vague during this period. There are references to "preparations" and "difficulties" and, ominously, "the incident with the goat," but no details. One letter suggests that Edmund nearly gave up twice. Another indicates that Rosalind's sisters became suspicious and had to be distracted with an elaborate scheme involving a false suitor.

What I can tell you is this: on the morning of the Harvest Festival, both kingdoms woke to discover that something had gone terribly wrong.

And by "terribly wrong," I mean: the parents had finally noticed.

---

In Easthollow, Queen Mathilda the Stern was having a very stern morning.

"You've been CORRESPONDING," she said to Rosalind. "With the ENEMY."

Rosalind considered denying it. But Gerald was sitting on her shoulder, looking extremely guilty (if pigeons can look guilty), and her bag full of classified documents was sitting on the floor between them where a guard had dropped it after searching her room.

"Technically," Rosalind said, "I've been conducting historical research."

"With the ENEMY."

"The enemy has relevant archives."

Queen Mathilda's eye twitched. "Guards found you trying to leave the castle at dawn. You had DOCUMENTS. STOLEN documents. From our OWN vault."

"I was going to give them back."

"You were going to EXPOSE them. At the FESTIVAL. In front of EVERYONE."

Rosalind saw no point in lying further. "Yes."

"Do you have any idea what you've done?"

"I've discovered that this entire war is based on a misunderstanding about a pudding, and I was trying to tell people so they could stop fighting."

There was a long silence.

"A pudding," Queen Mathilda said flatly.

"A pudding shaped like King Archibald's face. People ate it. He was offended. Nobody apologized. War."

"That's... that's ridiculous."

"I know. That's the point. The whole war is ridiculous. It's ALWAYS been ridiculous. And nobody talks about it because they're too embarrassed to admit they don't know why they're fighting."

Queen Mathilda sat down heavily in her chair. She looked, for a moment, less like a stern monarch and more like a very tired mother.

"How did you even discover this?"

"Letters. With someone in Westmarch. We both asked the same questions and shared what we found."

"Someone in... who?"

Rosalind hesitated. But Edmund was probably having this exact same conversation right now, in his own castle. There was no point in protecting secrets anymore.

"Prince Edmund. The fifth prince. He's like me—nobody pays attention to him, so he had time to investigate."

"You've been collaborating with an enemy prince."

"I've been collaborating with someone who wanted to know the truth. The enemy part is just... geography."

---

Meanwhile, in Westmarch, King Harold the Adequate was having a conversation that was almost word-for-word identical.

"You've been CORRESPONDING," he said to Edmund. "With the ENEMY."

"Technically—"

"There's no 'technically' in treason, Edmund!"

"It's not treason to want to understand history. I was just asking questions."

"You were planning to HUMILIATE this kingdom in front of everyone at the Festival!"

Edmund stood his ground. "I was planning to tell the TRUTH."

"The truth is that Easthollow attacked us!"

"No, Father. The truth is that we served their king a pudding shaped like his face, everyone laughed, he felt mocked, and nobody ever apologized. THAT'S the truth. I have the documents. I have the original recipe. I have the letter you—our ancestors—wrote but never sent."

King Harold went pale. "The letter was supposed to be destroyed."

"It wasn't. It's been sitting in the vault for three hundred years, marked 'burn this,' and nobody ever did. Because deep down, SOMEONE knew it was wrong to hide the truth."

The king was quiet for a long moment.

"How long have you known?"

"Weeks. Rosalind and I—"

"Rosalind?"

"Princess Rosalind. Of Easthollow. We've been working together."

King Harold sank into his throne. He looked old suddenly—older than Edmund had ever seen him.

"You've been working with the enemy. Trading secrets. Planning public revelations. And you did all this... why?"

"Because the war is STUPID." Edmund's voice cracked, but he didn't stop. "Because people are dying for a reason nobody understands. Because my whole life I've been told to hate Easthollow, but I've never known WHY, and when I finally figured it out, the answer was a DESSERT. A three-hundred-year war over HURT FEELINGS about a DESSERT."

"It wasn't just a dessert—"

"Yes it was! It was EXACTLY a dessert! And nobody wanted to admit it because it's embarrassing, and now generations of embarrassment have killed more people than any pudding ever could!"

Edmund was breathing hard. He'd never yelled at his father before. He'd never yelled at ANYONE before.

King Harold stared at his son for a long moment.

Then he said something unexpected: "You sound like my grandfather."

"What?"

"My grandfather. Your great-grandfather. He used to say the war was pointless. Used to say someone should find out how it started and end it. Nobody listened to him. They said he was too young, too naive, didn't understand politics." The king's voice was soft. "He died in a border skirmish when I was five years old."

Edmund didn't know what to say.

"I've spent my entire reign fighting this war," King Harold continued. "Because that's what kings do. That's what my father did, and his father, and HIS father. It never occurred to me to ask why. It was just... the war. How things were."

"How things don't have to be," Edmund said quietly.

"Perhaps." The king looked at the documents Edmund was clutching—the recipe, the letter, all of it. "You really were going to show these to everyone?"

"I was going to try."

"And the Easthollow princess—Rosalind—she has her own evidence?"

"She has documents from their archives that confirm everything."

King Harold stood and walked to the window. Outside, the kingdom was preparing for the Harvest Festival. Banners were being hung. Food was being prepared. Soon, the square would be full of people.

"The Festival starts in three hours," the king said.

"I know."

"If we do this—if we reveal this—there's no going back. Three hundred years of national identity, rewritten by a pudding."

"Three hundred years of pointless fighting, ended by the truth."

King Harold turned to look at his son. Fifth in line to the throne. Ignored. Overlooked. And somehow, more capable than anyone had realized.

"You really think this will work?"

"I think it might. And I think not trying is worse than failing."

The king nodded slowly. "Then I suppose we'd better talk to Easthollow."

"Talk to—?"

"If we're going to do this, we should do it together. Both kingdoms. Both revelations. At the same time." He smiled faintly. "That was your plan, wasn't it? Simultaneous exposure so neither side could deny it?"

"Yes, but... you're helping?"

"Someone has to. And apparently, the adults in this family have been useless for three hundred years." He put a hand on Edmund's shoulder. "Let's go send a message to Queen Mathilda. I believe you know a pigeon?"

---

Gerald, for once, flew the right direction on the first try.

Perhaps he knew that this time, it mattered.

Or perhaps he'd finally learned which way west was.

Either way, the message arrived.

And an hour later, against all odds and expectations, something unprecedented happened: the royal families of two enemy kingdoms agreed to meet.

Not on a battlefield.

Not through intermediaries.

But face to face, at the border bridge, to discuss a pudding.

History, as they say, was about to be made.

(I should note that some sources claim there was a second pigeon involved in the negotiations, and that Gerald was actually off eating bread somewhere during this crucial moment. I choose to believe Gerald was central to events. It makes for a better story.)
