# The Resolution

One year later, the kingdoms of Westmarch and Easthollow were still not at peace.

This might seem like a disappointing ending. You've followed Rosalind and Edmund through their investigation, their discovery, their dramatic revelation. You watched two monarchs apologize for a pudding on an ancient bridge. Surely, you might think, that should have fixed everything.

But wars don't end that easily. Even ridiculous wars. Even wars that everyone agrees should never have started. There are soldiers to bring home, borders to redraw, trade routes to reestablish. There are old resentments that can't be erased by a single speech, and new grievances that arise when people who have been enemies for generations suddenly have to learn how to be neighbors.

The truce held. That much I can tell you with certainty. In the year following the revelation, there were no battles, no skirmishes, no midnight raids. The armies returned to their barracks. The border guards stood down. The warning signs on the old stone bridge were replaced with ones that simply said: BRIDGE UNDER REPAIR.

(The bridge was, in fact, being repaired. It had been neglected for three centuries, and it turned out that vines, while picturesque, were not great for structural integrity.)

But if the war wasn't over, something important had changed: people were TALKING.

Not just kings and queens. Not just diplomats and generals. Regular people. Farmers on either side of the border discovered they had similar problems with irrigation. Merchants realized they'd been missing out on three centuries of trade. Children who had been taught to hate their neighbors began to wonder if maybe the hate was optional.

And in the middle of all this, two young people kept writing letters.

*Dear Edmund,*

*The peace negotiations are going slowly. Mother says this is normal—that "lasting peace takes longer than quick war." I'm not sure that's true, but she seems hopeful.*

*The archivists are speaking to me again, though they're still upset about the vault break-in. I've offered to help reorganize the pre-war section as an apology. They seemed surprised that I knew how to organize things. I think they expected me to be less competent than I am.*

*Gerald is doing well. He made it to Westmarch in only two wrong turns last time. I consider this a personal victory.*

*How are things on your end?*

*- Rosalind*

*Dear Rosalind,*

*Father put me in charge of the Historical Reconciliation Committee. I think he did it partly as punishment for the lock-picking, and partly because he genuinely thinks I'm good at this sort of thing. I'm not sure how I feel about being rewarded for treason.*

*We've been going through the old war records, identifying inaccuracies. Turns out, a LOT of what we were taught was wrong. Not just about the pudding—about everything. Both sides exaggerated their victories and minimized their defeats. The "Glorious Battle of Miller's Field" was apparently more of a "Confused Skirmish Near Some Cows." Nobody wants to admit this.*

*I've started a new project: a complete, honest history of the war. Both sides' perspectives. No propaganda. Just facts, as best we can determine them.*

*It's going to take years. Maybe decades.*

*I think it will be worth it.*

*- Edmund*

---

*Dear Edmund,*

*Your honest history project sounds wonderful. Would you like help? I've become rather good at finding hidden documents and interpreting badly preserved sources.*

*Also, I should mention: I'm coming to Westmarch. Officially. As part of a diplomatic delegation. My first official diplomatic mission, which is ironic given that my UNofficial diplomatic mission is what started all of this.*

*We'll be there for a month, negotiating trade agreements. Very boring, but it means I can actually SEE you instead of just writing. And perhaps meet this "someone else" who helped end a war.*

*Unless you've become too important for old friends.*

*- Rosalind*

*P.S. - Gerald is coming. He's very excited. Or possibly just hungry. It's hard to tell with pigeons.*

---

*Dear Rosalind,*

*I will never be too important for old friends. Especially old friends who taught me that asking questions isn't treason, even when adults say it is.*

*Come to Westmarch. We'll show you the vault you inadvertently embarrassed, and the Historical Society where all our evidence is now properly archived, and the bakery that's trying to recreate the Triumphant Pudding recipe.*

*(Yes, really. Someone decided that if a pudding started the war, a pudding should help end it. They're calling it "Reconciliation Pudding." It's surprisingly popular. Nobody eats it in front of portraits anymore, though. Just in case.)*

*Safe travels. Say hello to Gerald for me.*

*- Edmund*

The diplomatic delegation arrived in Westmarch on a sunny morning in early spring. It was the first official visit from Easthollow in over three hundred years, and the entire capital turned out to watch.

Rosalind walked at the front of the delegation, next to Queen Mathilda. She was wearing official diplomatic attire—uncomfortable but impressive—and carrying, in a small cage, one thoroughly confused pigeon.

Gerald had insisted on coming. Or rather, Rosalind had insisted on bringing him. He was, after all, the one who had started this. That misdirected message, that first accidental contact, had changed everything.

(Gerald was currently attempting to eat his own feathers. He was still not the smartest pigeon. But he was the most historically significant.)

The Westmarch welcoming party stood in the castle courtyard. King Harold looked appropriately regal. His advisors looked appropriately nervous. And at the edge of the group, looking neither regal nor nervous but simply happy, stood Edmund.

He caught Rosalind's eye across the courtyard and smiled.

She smiled back.

Later, after the official greetings and the formal dinners and the lengthy speeches about cooperation and reconciliation, they found a quiet moment on the castle balcony.

"You did it," Edmund said. "We did it."

"We did SOMETHING," Rosalind corrected. "The war isn't over yet."

"But it will be. Eventually. Because of what we started."

"Because of what Gerald started, really. If he hadn't flown the wrong direction that first time..."

"Gerald is a very important historical figure. I've noted this in my new history book."

Rosalind laughed. "He'll be thrilled. He can't read, but he'll be thrilled."

They looked out over the city—a city that had been enemy territory when they'd first begun writing, and now was simply... a city. Foreign, but not frightening. Different, but not dangerous.

"I've been thinking," Edmund said. "About what comes next."

"The peace treaties. The trade agreements. Years of careful diplomacy."

"Yes, all of that. But also..." He hesitated. "I want to write a book. A real book, not just historical records. About how this happened. How two people who should have been enemies became friends instead."

"That could be dangerous. Some people still don't like the truth."

"I know. But I think... I think stories matter. The story we were told—that Easthollow was evil, that the war was just—that story kept people fighting for three centuries. Maybe a new story, a true story, could help people understand that things can change."

Rosalind was quiet for a moment. Then she said: "I'd like to help. If you want a co-author."

"I was hoping you'd say that."

"Two perspectives. Both sides. Just like the investigation."

"Exactly like the investigation." Edmund smiled. "We make a good team."

"We make an UNLIKELY team. A princess and a prince who were supposed to be enemies."

"The best teams are always unlikely. The likely ones never accomplish anything interesting."

From somewhere inside the castle, the sound of music drifted out—the first official ball between the two kingdoms in three hundred years. People who had never met were dancing together, learning each other's steps, finding common ground.

Gerald cooed from his perch on the balcony railing. He had somehow escaped his cage again. Nobody knew how.

"Should we join the ball?" Rosalind asked.

"In a moment. I want to remember this first." Edmund looked at the stars, at the city, at the future spreading out before them. "The night the war really ended. Not with a treaty, but with a dance."

"It hasn't ended yet."

"No. But it will. And this is where it started to end. Right here. Right now."

Rosalind thought about this. About the letters, and the bridge, and the pudding. About Gerald flying the wrong direction. About two kingdoms learning, slowly, how to stop being enemies.

"You know what the funny thing is?" she said.

"What?"

"If that first message had gone to the right place—to the actual archives, like it was supposed to—none of this would have happened. A clerk would have filed it away. Nobody would have answered. We never would have connected."

"Gerald's terrible sense of direction saved two kingdoms."

"Gerald's terrible sense of direction saved two kingdoms," Rosalind agreed. "I'm going to make sure that goes in the history books."

They stayed on the balcony a little longer, watching the stars. Then, together, they went to join the dance.

---

I told you at the beginning of this story that I wasn't there when any of this happened. That I pieced it together from incomplete sources, contradictory accounts, and one very smudged letter.

This is all still true.

But I've done my best to tell the story as it happened—or at least, as it might have happened. The essential facts are accurate: there was a war, it was based on a misunderstanding, and two young people who should have been enemies chose to be friends instead.

The details? Well. You've read what I have. You can decide for yourself what you believe.

What I can tell you with certainty is this:

The war did end, eventually. The peace treaty was signed three years after the Harvest Festival revelation. Both kingdoms prospered. The border bridge was fully repaired and became a popular meeting place for travelers from both lands.

The Triumphant Pudding recipe was officially renamed "The Friendship Pudding" and is now served at every major diplomatic function. It is, by all accounts, delicious. Nobody eats it in front of portraits.

Edmund and Rosalind did write their book. It was controversial, praised by reformers and criticized by traditionalists. It became required reading in both kingdoms' schools. Generations of children learned that asking questions wasn't just acceptable—it was necessary.

Gerald lived to the remarkable age of seventeen, which is very old for a pigeon. He was given a state funeral. Both kingdoms sent representatives.

And somewhere, in a quiet corner of history, the lesson remained:

Wars are easier to start than to end. But sometimes, all it takes to change everything is a single question, asked by someone brave enough to listen for the answer.

Why are we fighting?

It's worth asking.

It's always worth asking.

THE END

*Note from the Somewhat Reliable Narrator:*

*If you've made it this far, thank you for trusting me with this story. I've done my best, but I'm sure I got some things wrong. History is like that—full of gaps and guesses and well-intentioned mistakes.*

*If you ever find better sources than the ones I used, I hope you'll write your own version. The truth, after all, belongs to everyone who looks for it.*

*And if a confused pigeon ever delivers a message to your window by mistake...*

*Consider answering.*

*You never know where it might lead.*
