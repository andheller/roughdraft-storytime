# The Confrontation

The meeting at the border bridge was, by all accounts, extremely awkward.

I have three eyewitness descriptions of this event, and they agree on almost nothing except this: everyone stood in uncomfortable silence for far too long before anyone spoke.

On the Westmarch side: King Harold the Adequate, Prince Edmund, and a small group of anxious advisors who kept checking to make sure this wasn't an elaborate trap.

On the Easthollow side: Queen Mathilda the Stern (looking particularly stern), Princess Rosalind, and an equally anxious group of advisors who were checking for the same thing.

In the middle of the bridge: nobody, because nobody wanted to be first.

"Well," King Harold said finally. "This is uncomfortable."

"Extremely," Queen Mathilda agreed.

They stared at each other.

"Your son," the queen said, "has been corresponding with my daughter."

"Your daughter has been corresponding with my son."

"They've uncovered something rather embarrassing about our war."

"So I've been told. A pudding."

"A pudding shaped like King Archibald's face, which your kingdom served at a diplomatic banquet and then ate while laughing."

"The laughing was because the pudding was delicious. Not because of mockery."

"And you know this... how?"

"I read the original recipe. It was genuinely good pudding. Apparently."

More awkward silence.

Edmund and Rosalind exchanged glances. Their parents were circling each other like two cats who weren't sure whether to fight or flee.

"Perhaps," Rosalind said carefully, "we should show them the evidence. All of it. Together."

The adults looked at their children—these troublesome young people who had, somehow, done what three centuries of diplomats and generals couldn't.

"Go on, then," Queen Mathilda said. "Show us."

Edmund and Rosalind stepped into the center of the bridge. They laid out their documents side by side: the recipe, the unsent apology, the advisor's letter, the painting detail, the classified files from both vaults.

"Here's what we know," Edmund began. "Three hundred years ago, Westmarch hosted a diplomatic banquet for Easthollow. As a tribute to King Archibald, they created a special dessert: the Triumphant Pudding, shaped like the king's face."

"It was meant to be an honor," Rosalind continued. "Like a portrait, but edible. A celebration of the guest of honor."

"But nobody explained this to King Archibald beforehand."

"So when the Westmarch court began eating the pudding—"

"Enthusiastically—"

"Because it was delicious—"

"King Archibald thought they were mocking him." Edmund held up the advisor's letter. "This letter confirms it. He felt humiliated. He left the banquet, and by morning, both kingdoms had declared war."

"But here's the thing," Rosalind said. "King Bartholomew of Westmarch tried to apologize." She held up the unsent letter. "He wrote this. He explained the misunderstanding. He begged for forgiveness. But someone wrote 'burn this' on it, and it was never sent."

"Why?" King Harold asked. His voice was quiet.

"Pride, probably," Edmund said. "By the time the letter was written, war had already started. Sending it would have meant admitting a mistake. So someone filed it away and pretended it didn't exist."

"And then," Rosalind concluded, "it was just... easier to keep fighting than to explain what had happened. Every generation forgot a little more of the truth, until nobody knew why the war started. They just knew that it HAD started, and that the other side was the enemy."

The adults stared at the documents.

King Harold picked up the recipe. "The Triumphant Pudding," he read. "Flour, butter, cream, sugar, twelve eggs, essence of vanilla, strawberry preserve for the noble complexion..."

"It sounds delicious," Queen Mathilda admitted reluctantly.

"It was meant to be. It was meant to be the BEST pudding anyone had ever made, in honor of the visiting king."

"But nobody TOLD him that."

"No. Nobody told him."

More silence. But this silence was different. Thoughtful rather than hostile.

"Three hundred years," Queen Mathilda said softly. "All those soldiers. All those families. All those... everything. For a PUDDING."

"For a lack of communication about a pudding," Rosalind corrected. "The pudding itself was innocent."

"The pudding was DELICIOUS," King Harold added, still reading the recipe. "According to everyone who ate it."

Queen Mathilda turned to look at him. They had never met before—not in person. They had written threatening letters. They had sent armies against each other. But they had never stood this close.

"Your ancestors started this," she said, but her voice lacked conviction.

"Your ancestors CONTINUED it. For three hundred years."

"So did yours."

"I'm not denying that."

They stared at each other. Then, slowly, King Harold began to smile. It was a small smile, slightly embarrassed, but unmistakably real.

"This is absolutely absurd," he said.

"Completely ridiculous," Queen Mathilda agreed.

"We've been enemies for generations over a DESSERT."

"A dessert that looked like my great-great-great-great-something grandfather's face."

"A very distinguished face, by all accounts."

"He had an excellent beard."

"The pudding had an excellent beard too, apparently. The recipe mentions 'spun sugar for the noble whiskers.'"

Queen Mathilda laughed. It was a short, surprised sound, like something escaping against her will.

"This is what our children discovered," she said. "While we were busy planning military campaigns and teaching them to hate each other."

"They figured it out in a few months. We've had three centuries."

"To be fair," Edmund offered, "you were all rather busy fighting."

"Fighting about NOTHING," his father said. "Fighting because our parents fought, because THEIR parents fought, because nobody wanted to be the first to ask WHY."

"Somebody should have asked," Queen Mathilda said. "Somebody should have asked a long time ago."

"We're asking now," Rosalind said. "And we're not just asking—we're answering. The question is: what do we do about it?"

Both monarchs looked at each other across the bridge. The advisors on both sides were remarkably quiet, probably still processing the idea that their entire professional lives had been based on a pudding dispute.

"We could announce a truce," King Harold said slowly. "A temporary cessation of hostilities while we... investigate."

"Investigate what? The evidence is right here."

"While we PRETEND to investigate. Give people time to adjust. Let the news sink in gradually."

"Or," Queen Mathilda said, "we could do what should have been done three hundred years ago."

"Which is?"

She held up the unsent apology letter. "Actually apologize."

King Harold blinked. "Now?"

"Now. Today. In front of witnesses. A formal apology for the pudding incident, three hundred years late." She looked at the letter. "This should have been sent to my ancestor. It never was. But I could accept it now, on his behalf."

"And I could offer it. On behalf of mine." King Harold straightened. "An apology from the House of Westmarch to the House of Easthollow, for any offense caused by a celebratory pudding intended as an honor."

"And an acceptance from the House of Easthollow, with acknowledgment that the offense was unintentional and regrettable."

"And then," King Harold said, almost smiling, "perhaps we could discuss... not being at war anymore?"

"Gradually. These things take time."

"Of course. Treaties to negotiate. Borders to establish. Probably forms to fill out."

"Definitely forms. Kingdoms run on forms."

They looked at each other, and something shifted. Not friendship—not yet—but something better than enmity. Something that might, in time, become understanding.

"Your daughter is quite remarkable," King Harold said.

"Your son is equally remarkable. Did you know he picked three locks to get into your vault?"

"He did WHAT?"

"Later, Father," Edmund said quickly. "That's a conversation for later."

Rosalind grinned at him across the bridge.

Gerald, perched on Rosalind's shoulder, cooed triumphantly. Even he seemed to understand that something important had just happened.

"The Harvest Festival is starting soon," Queen Mathilda observed. "In both kingdoms. Crowds are gathering."

"Perhaps we should make an announcement," King Harold said. "Both of us. Together. Before our people spend another day celebrating a war that never needed to happen."

"Together," Queen Mathilda agreed.

They turned to face their respective sides of the bridge.

"PEOPLE OF WESTMARCH AND EASTHOLLOW," King Harold began, his voice carrying across the water. "TODAY, SOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED HAS OCCURRED..."

---

I should note that the speech that followed has been recorded in seventeen different versions, none of which agree on the exact wording. What all versions do agree on is that, by the end of the speech:

1. Both kingdoms knew the truth about the war.
2. Both kingdoms were extremely embarrassed.
3. A formal truce was declared, pending further negotiations.
4. And somewhere, in the gathered crowds, someone started laughing—and the laughter spread, because sometimes the only reasonable response to absurdity is joy.

The war wasn't over. Not yet. Three hundred years of conflict couldn't be undone in a single afternoon. There would be treaties to write, grievances to address, wounds to heal.

But for the first time in three centuries, people on both sides of the border looked at each other and saw something other than enemies.

They saw fellow victims of a very, very bad joke.

And somehow, that made all the difference.
