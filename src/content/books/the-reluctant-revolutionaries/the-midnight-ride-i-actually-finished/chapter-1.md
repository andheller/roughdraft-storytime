# Chapter 1: I Was Just Returning a Pie Dish

My name is Mercy Prescott, I am eleven years old, and I need you to understand something very important: I was JUST returning a pie dish.

That's it. That's all I was doing on the night of April 18th, 1775.

My mother had borrowed Mrs. Hancock's fancy pie dish three weeks ago, and every single day since then she'd said, "Mercy, take this back to the Hancock house." And every single day I'd said, "I'll do it tomorrow."

Well, tomorrow finally came. At nine o'clock at night. Because my mother threatened to make me wash dishes for a MONTH if I didn't return it RIGHT NOW.

"It's dark outside!" I protested.

"Then you should have returned it this morning," Mama said. "Take the horse. The Hancocks are only in Lexington visiting. It's barely an hour's ride."

"Fine," I grumbled, grabbing the pie dish. "But if I get eaten by wolves, you'll be sorry."

"There are no wolves in Massachusetts, Mercy."

"There COULD be."

I should tell you a little about what was happening in Massachusetts in 1775, because it's important to the story of how I accidentally became a hero.

Basically, everyone was mad at the King of England.

The grown-ups talked about it constantly: taxes on tea, soldiers in our streets, "no taxation without representation" (I didn't fully understand that one, but I nodded along). My cousin Samuel, who was a doctor, spent half his time tending to patients and the other half at secret meetings with men who whispered about "liberty" and "revolution."

"Something's coming," my father would say at dinner, looking worried. "Something big."

I didn't care about something big. I cared about my chores, my best friend Hannah, and whether I could convince my parents to let me have a kitten.

Politics was for grown-ups.

Or so I thought.

The ride to Lexington was peaceful enough. Our horse, Buttercup, was old and slow but steady. The April air was cool, and the stars were bright. I actually started to enjoy myself.

I was about halfway there when I saw the lights.

Lanterns. In the steeple of the Old North Church, way off in the distance toward Boston.

Two lanterns.

I stopped Buttercup and stared. Everyone in town knew what two lanterns meant. The signal had been arranged weeks ago: one lantern if the British soldiers were marching out of Boston by land. Two lanterns if they were crossing the Charles River by boat.

Two lanterns meant the British were coming by sea.

"Oh no," I whispered.

Buttercup snorted, which I think meant "This seems like someone else's problem."

"You're right," I told her. "We're just returning a pie dish. Whatever's happening, it's not our business."

I kept riding toward Lexington.

I had almost convinced myself everything was fine when I heard hoofbeats.

Fast hoofbeats. Coming toward me.

I pulled Buttercup off the road and into the shadows of some trees, my heart pounding. If those were British soldiers...

A rider burst past me at full gallop. In the moonlight, I caught a glimpse of his face.

It was Paul Revere. The silversmith. Everyone in Boston knew Paul Revere.

"THE REGULARS ARE COMING!" he shouted as he rode. "THE REGULARS ARE COMING OUT!"

He disappeared down the road toward Lexington, still shouting.

"See, Buttercup?" I said, my voice shaky. "Someone's already handling it. Mr. Revere's warning everyone. We can just deliver our pie dish and go home."

Buttercup snorted again. Even she didn't believe me.

---

I made it to Lexington around ten-thirty. The town was in an uproar. Men were running around with muskets. Lanterns bobbed everywhere. Someone was ringing the church bell so hard I thought it might fall out of the steeple.

I found the house where Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams were staying. (Mr. Samuel Adams, the famous one who organized all the protests. Not my cousin Samuel, who just complained about the British while setting broken arms.)

I knocked on the door, holding up the pie dish.

A very frazzled woman answered. "WHAT?"

"Um... pie dish? From my mother? She borrowed it?"

The woman stared at me like I'd grown a second head.

"There's a WAR starting and you're here about a PIE DISH?"

"My mother was very insistent."

She grabbed the dish, shoved it somewhere behind her, and slammed the door.

Well. That was done. Time to go home.

I turned around to find Buttercup—and ran directly into Paul Revere.

"Whoa there!" He grabbed my shoulders to steady me. "You're Samuel Prescott's cousin, aren't you? The doctor?"

"Yes sir. I was just—"

"Perfect! Your cousin's here somewhere. We need every rider we can get. The British are marching to Concord to seize the weapons stored there. We have to warn them!"

"I'm not a rider, I'm just—"

"You have a horse, don't you?" He pointed at Buttercup.

"She's very old—"

"She'll do. Find your cousin. Tell him to ride for Concord. I'm going with William Dawes. We'll take the main road."

And then Paul Revere was gone, running off to find his own horse.

I stood in the middle of the chaos, holding nothing, completely confused.

"I was just returning a pie dish," I said to no one.

No one answered.

Somewhere in the distance, a drum started beating.

---

I found my cousin Samuel ten minutes later. He was already on his horse, checking a pistol.

"Mercy!" He looked surprised. "What are you doing here?"

"Pie dish."

"What?"

"Never mind. Mr. Revere said you're supposed to ride to Concord?"

Samuel nodded grimly. "I'm going with him and Mr. Dawes. The British are after the weapons and supplies hidden there. We have to warn the town."

"Great. Good luck. I'm going home."

I started toward Buttercup.

"Mercy, wait."

I turned around.

Samuel looked at me seriously. "If something happens to us... if we don't make it... someone needs to finish the warning. Concord HAS to know."

"What do you mean 'if you don't make it'?"

"The roads are full of British patrols. If we're captured..."

"You won't be captured. You're adults. You know what you're doing."

Samuel almost smiled. "Mercy. I've never done anything like this before. None of us have. We're making it up as we go along."

He rode off before I could respond.

I watched him disappear into the darkness, toward Revere and Dawes.

"He'll be fine," I told Buttercup. "They'll all be fine."

I climbed onto Buttercup's back.

I pointed her toward home.

And then, for reasons I still don't fully understand, I turned her around and followed my cousin into the night.

Just to make sure he was okay.

Just for a little while.

Just until I knew everyone was safe.

I had a very bad feeling about this.
