# Chapter 3: The Part Where Everyone Gets Captured (Except Me)

We reached Concord just as the sky started turning gray with dawn.

The town was chaos.

Men ran everywhere with muskets and powder horns. Women carried bundles of supplies out of buildings. A group of teenagers was rolling barrels of something (gunpowder? flour? I couldn't tell) into a barn. An old man stood in the town square shouting directions that nobody seemed to be following.

"THE CANNONS GO IN BARRET'S FARM! NOT THE CHURCH! BARRET'S FARM!"

"I thought they were going to Jones' barn!"

"Jones' barn is full of CHICKENS, Henry!"

Samuel grabbed a man running past. "Who's in charge?"

"Colonel Barrett! He's at the North Bridge organizing the militia!" The man ran off.

Samuel turned to me. "You. Home. NOW."

"But—"

"MERCY."

His face was so serious that I didn't argue. I turned Buttercup toward the road home.

"Be careful!" I called over my shoulder.

Samuel was already gone, galloping toward the North Bridge.

---

I should have gone home.

I was exhausted. Buttercup was exhausted. My mother was probably terrified, wondering where I was. Every sensible part of my brain was screaming GO HOME.

But as I rode through Concord, I saw something that made me stop.

A group of women and children were hurrying out of a house, carrying armfuls of musket balls and gunpowder horns. One woman stumbled, and musket balls scattered everywhere, rolling across the dirt street.

"Leave them!" another woman shouted. "There's no time!"

"We can't leave them! The Regulars will find them!"

I jumped off Buttercup.

"I'll help," I said, already scooping up musket balls.

The women looked at me in surprise, but there was no time for questions. Together, we gathered everything and carried it to a wagon waiting at the edge of town.

"Where are you taking this?" I asked.

"Barret's farm. Everything's being hidden there."

"I can help carry more."

And that's how, instead of going home, I spent the next two hours helping hide weapons and supplies from the British army.

---

**True Historical Fact**: The people of Concord hid their military supplies in some very creative places. They buried cannons in fields. They threw musket balls into barrels of feathers. They hid gunpowder in attics, cellars, and at least one chicken coop. When the British arrived, they searched everywhere—but the colonists had done such a good job hiding things that the Regulars only found a small portion of the supplies.

I personally helped hide:
- Seventeen muskets (in a hay wagon)
- Four barrels of gunpowder (behind a false wall in a barn)
- One small cannon (I didn't actually help with this one, but I watched)
- Eight hundred musket balls (in about forty different hiding spots)

It felt like I was finally doing something important. Something that mattered.

And then the British arrived.

---

They marched into town around seven in the morning—hundreds of Redcoats in perfect rows, drums beating, fifes playing. They looked terrifying and impressive and very, very organized.

The colonists... did not look organized.

There were maybe a hundred militia members gathered on a hill overlooking the town, and they kept arguing about what to do. Should they fight? Should they wait? Should they retreat?

I was hiding behind a stone wall with some other kids, watching.

"Are they gonna shoot?" whispered a boy next to me.

"I don't know."

"My pa's out there."

"So's my cousin."

We watched as the British soldiers spread out through the town. Some went to search buildings. Others marched toward the North Bridge, where the militia was gathered.

I couldn't see Samuel anywhere.

The British started searching houses. They found a few cannons that hadn't been hidden well enough. They threw them into the millpond. They found some wooden gun carriages and set them on fire.

And then someone screamed.

"THE TOWN'S ON FIRE!"

Smoke was rising from the courthouse. The fire from the gun carriages had spread—or maybe the British had set it deliberately. Either way, flames were licking at the building.

The militia on the hill saw the smoke.

And everything changed.

---

I saw it happen from my hiding spot behind the wall.

The militia—the farmers and shopkeepers and doctors who'd been arguing all morning—saw their town burning. And something snapped.

They started marching.

Not retreating. Not hiding. MARCHING. Toward the North Bridge. Toward the British soldiers.

"Don't fire unless fired upon," someone shouted. "But if they want a fight, BY GOD WE'LL GIVE THEM ONE!"

I grabbed the boy next to me. "We need to move. NOW."

We scrambled away from the wall, away from the bridge, toward the edge of town. Behind us, I heard shouting. Orders. Confusion.

And then—

BANG.

A musket shot.

Then another. And another.

I threw myself behind a rain barrel and covered my ears, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would explode.

The shooting lasted maybe two minutes. Maybe less. But it felt like forever.

When it finally stopped, I peeked around the barrel.

The British soldiers at the bridge were running. RUNNING. Away from the militia. Back toward town.

The colonists had won.

---

I found Samuel an hour later. He had a cut on his forehead where a musket ball had grazed him, but he was alive. He was helping carry a wounded man to a house being used as a hospital.

"MERCY!" He almost dropped the stretcher. "What are you—I told you to go HOME!"

"I helped hide muskets!"

"You were supposed to LEAVE!"

"I helped hide A CANNON!"

He stared at me for a long moment. Then, somehow, despite everything—despite the battle and the wounded and the chaos—he laughed.

"You are EXACTLY like your mother," he said. "She once punched a tax collector."

"She WHAT?"

"Long story. Help me with this stretcher."

I helped.

The British retreated from Concord that day. But as they marched back toward Boston, colonists attacked them from behind every tree, every stone wall, every farmhouse. By the end of the day, the Regulars had lost hundreds of soldiers.

The American Revolution had begun.

And I had been there.

Me. Mercy Prescott. Eleven years old. Pie dish returner. Accidental revolutionary.
