# Chapter 4: The Shot Heard Round the World (I Heard It Too)

The days after the battle were the strangest of my life.

I didn't go home right away. The roads were full of British soldiers retreating to Boston, and nobody wanted me to travel alone. So I stayed in Concord with Samuel, helping where I could.

And everywhere I went, people were talking.

"Did you hear? We beat them! We actually BEAT the British Army!"

"Hundreds of Redcoats, running like scared rabbits!"

"This is it—this is the beginning of something!"

A farmer in the town square was reading aloud from a pamphlet someone had printed just that morning. "Let the word go forth to all the colonies: the farmers of Massachusetts have stood against tyranny—and WON!"

I listened, hugging my knees to my chest.

I had helped. I had actually helped.

**True Historical Fact**: The Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19th, 1775, were the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War. By the end of the day, 73 British soldiers were dead and 174 were wounded. The colonists lost 49 men, with 39 wounded. The phrase "the shot heard round the world" comes from a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson, written many years later, describing the first shot fired at the North Bridge.

Nobody knows who fired that first shot. It might have been a British soldier. It might have been a colonist. It might have been an accident.

But once it happened, there was no going back.

Samuel found me on the third day, sitting behind the makeshift hospital, staring at nothing.

"Thinking about home?" he asked, sitting down beside me.

"Thinking about everything."

He nodded. "It's a lot to take in. You're eleven. You shouldn't have seen any of this."

"I'm almost twelve."

"Oh, well, that changes everything."

I smiled a little.

"Mercy," Samuel said carefully, "what you did—riding through the night, dodging patrols, helping warn Concord—that was incredibly brave."

"I was scared the whole time."

"That's what brave means. Being scared and doing it anyway."

I thought about Buttercup, plodding through the darkness. About the soldiers I'd barely escaped in Lincoln. About the musket balls rolling across the dirt street.

"I just wanted to help," I said.

"You did. More than you know."

On the fourth day, a group of riders came from Cambridge with news.

Militia from all over New England were gathering. Thousands of men—farmers, blacksmiths, shopkeepers, teachers—all marching toward Boston to trap the British inside the city.

"It's really happening," Samuel said, reading a letter from the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. "They're forming an army."

"A real army? Like with generals and uniforms and everything?"

"Something like that. They're talking about a man named Washington—he's from Virginia. They want him to lead."

I thought about Theo Finch, a boy from Philadelphia my mother's friend had mentioned in her letters. He was about my age. I wondered if he'd end up caught up in this war too.

(Little did I know, Theo's adventures would be even more ridiculous than mine. But that's another story.)

---

On the fifth day, I finally went home.

Samuel escorted me most of the way, until the roads were safe enough for me to continue alone. He gave me a letter to deliver to my parents, explaining where I'd been and what had happened.

"You're going to be in SO much trouble," he said cheerfully.

"Thanks for the encouragement."

"You're also going to be a hero. But first, trouble."

He was right about both.

My mother was standing in the doorway when I rode up.

For a long moment, she just stared at me. I couldn't tell if she was angry or relieved or about to cry. Maybe all three.

"Mercy Elizabeth Prescott," she said slowly.

"I can explain—"

"You were gone for FIVE DAYS."

"I know, but—"

"FIVE. DAYS."

"There was a battle! And British soldiers! And I helped hide a cannon!"

She walked down the steps. Slowly. Her eyes never left my face.

I braced myself for the lecture of a lifetime.

Instead, she hugged me.

So hard I couldn't breathe.

"Don't you EVER do that to me again," she whispered.

"I won't. I promise. I just—"

"You helped hide a CANNON?"

"It wasn't that big of a cannon."

She pulled back and looked at me. And despite the tears in her eyes, she was smiling.

"Tell me everything."

---

I told her everything.

About the pie dish. About following Samuel. About the two lanterns in the Old North Church. About Paul Revere getting captured. About dodging patrols in Lincoln. About hiding weapons with the women of Concord. About the shot at the North Bridge.

By the end, my father had joined us, and the neighbors, and pretty much half the town.

"She rode all night?" Mr. Henderson asked, impressed.

"Through British patrols?" Mrs. Patterson gasped.

"On BUTTERCUP?" old Mr. Collins said skeptically. "That horse is older than I am."

"She's very brave when she's scared," I said, defending my horse.

My mother put her arm around me.

"That's my girl," she said. "Brave when she's scared."

That night, I lay in my own bed for the first time in almost a week.

The sheets were clean. The pillow was soft. There were no cannons, no muskets, no British soldiers.

Just silence.

I should have fallen asleep immediately. Instead, I stared at the ceiling, thinking.

The war had started. A real war, against the most powerful empire in the world. People were going to fight. People were going to die. Nothing was ever going to be the same.

And I had been there at the beginning.

Me. An eleven-year-old girl who was just trying to return a pie dish.

"I didn't ask for this," I whispered to the darkness.

The darkness didn't answer.

Outside my window, I could hear the distant sound of drums. More militia, marching toward Boston.

The revolution was just beginning.

And somehow, I knew it wasn't done with me yet.
