# Chapter 2: Two Lanterns and a Whole Lot of Trouble

I should not have followed them.

I knew that approximately thirty seconds after I started, when Buttercup stepped in a hole and almost threw me off. But by then, I could hear hoofbeats ahead—Samuel and Mr. Revere and Mr. Dawes, riding toward Concord—and I thought, "Well, I'm already here. Might as well make sure they're okay."

This is what my mother calls "Mercy Logic." She does not mean it as a compliment.

The road to Concord was dark and quiet. Too quiet. Every shadow looked like a British soldier. Every rustle in the bushes made me jump. Buttercup, bless her ancient heart, plodded along like we were taking a Sunday stroll.

"Could you maybe go a LITTLE faster?" I whispered.

Buttercup did not go faster.

I could see the three riders ahead of me now, small shapes in the moonlight. They'd slowed down, talking quietly. Planning, probably. Important revolutionary planning that had nothing to do with eleven-year-old girls on elderly horses.

And then I heard it.

"HALT! IN THE NAME OF THE KING!"

British soldiers burst out of the trees ahead. I counted four... no, five... no, at least six of them, all on horseback, blocking the road.

I yanked Buttercup to a stop and threw myself off her back, scrambling into the bushes at the side of the road. My heart was pounding so hard I was sure the soldiers could hear it.

From my hiding spot, I watched the disaster unfold.

---

Mr. Dawes panicked. He wheeled his horse around and galloped back the way they'd come—and then his horse stumbled, and he went flying off into a ditch.

Mr. Revere tried to escape into the woods, but more soldiers appeared from the trees. They surrounded him, pistols drawn.

"Don't shoot!" Mr. Revere shouted. "I'm just a traveler—"

"Paul Revere," one of the soldiers said coldly. "We know exactly who you are."

They dragged him off his horse.

But Samuel—my cousin Samuel—he did something different.

He kicked his horse straight at the soldiers, like he was going to charge through them. They scattered, surprised. And in that split second of confusion, Samuel veered off the road into a field, jumped a stone wall, and disappeared into the darkness.

"AFTER HIM!" a soldier shouted.

Two riders chased him, but Samuel knew this land. He'd been making house calls out here for years. Within moments, the sound of pursuit faded.

He'd escaped.

I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding.

But now Mr. Revere was captured. Mr. Dawes was lying in a ditch. And the only rider left was Samuel—riding alone toward Concord, with who knows how many more patrols between here and there.

The soldiers marched Mr. Revere away, leaving the road empty and silent.

I stayed hidden in the bushes for a long, long time.

---

"What do I do?" I whispered to Buttercup, who had wandered over to eat some grass near my hiding spot. "I'm just a kid. I can't do anything. I should go home."

Buttercup chewed her grass.

"Samuel got away. He'll warn Concord. It's fine. It's handled."

More chewing.

"But what if there are more patrols? What if they catch him too?"

Buttercup looked at me with her big, brown eyes. She did not have answers. She was a horse.

I thought about what Samuel had said: *If something happens to us, if we don't make it, someone needs to finish the warning.*

Concord had to know. The British were coming for the weapons and supplies hidden there—cannons, gunpowder, musket balls. If the colonists lost those, they'd have nothing to fight with.

I was just a kid.

But I had a horse. And I knew the roads. And nobody was looking for an eleven-year-old girl with a pie dish problem.

"Buttercup," I said slowly, "how do you feel about being a revolutionary?"

Buttercup ate more grass.

"I'll take that as a yes."

---

I didn't take the main road. That would be stupid—the main road was full of British soldiers who'd already captured Paul Revere. Instead, I guided Buttercup through the back paths and farm lanes that I'd explored during summers visiting my aunt.

The night was getting colder. My fingers were numb. My backside was sore from sitting on Buttercup's bony spine. But I kept going.

Every few minutes, I'd stop and listen.

Hoofbeats in the distance—I'd duck into the trees.

Voices—I'd hold my breath.

Once, I heard gunshots somewhere far away. I froze, terrified, imagining Samuel lying wounded in a field. But then I remembered: it was probably just farmers waking up, getting their muskets ready. The alarm was spreading, even without me.

Still. Concord needed to be warned. Not just farmers along the way—the TOWN. The people in charge. They needed time to hide the weapons, to gather the militia, to prepare.

I kicked Buttercup into something resembling a trot.

"Come on, girl. We can do this."

---

I almost ran into the patrol outside Lincoln.

One second the road was empty. The next, there were two soldiers on horseback, maybe twenty feet ahead of me.

"HALT!" one shouted.

I did not halt.

I yanked Buttercup's reins hard to the left, and we crashed through someone's vegetable garden, cabbages flying everywhere. Behind me, I heard shouting and hoofbeats.

"It's just a child! Leave her!"

"She might be a messenger! After her!"

Buttercup was old, but she was also terrified, and terror made her fast. We burst through a hedge, crossed someone's cow pasture (the cows were very surprised), and scrambled over a stone wall that I'm pretty sure Buttercup was too old to jump. She jumped it anyway.

The hoofbeats behind us faded.

I pulled Buttercup to a stop in a small grove of trees, panting.

"Good girl," I gasped, patting her neck. "VERY good girl."

We'd made it.

But Concord was still miles away. And the night wasn't getting any younger.

I kept riding.

---

Around three in the morning, I saw Samuel.

He was outside the house of a militia captain, talking urgently. When he saw me ride up, his face went pale.

"MERCY?! What are you—why are you—HOW are you here?!"

"Pie dish," I said, too tired for a better explanation. "Also, I followed you. Also, the British captured Mr. Revere. Also, there are patrols everywhere."

Samuel grabbed Buttercup's bridle. "You can't be here. It's too dangerous. You need to go home RIGHT NOW."

"I will. But first—did you warn them? Did you warn Concord?"

He shook his head grimly. "I warned the farms along the way, but I had to circle wide to dodge the patrols. I'm still trying to get to the center of town."

"Then let's go together."

"Absolutely not."

"Samuel, I know the back paths. I just dodged two patrols to get here. You're a grownup on a fast horse—they're looking for you. Nobody's looking for me."

He stared at me. I could see him wanting to argue.

But there wasn't time.

In the distance, church bells were ringing. Drums were beating. The whole countryside was waking up.

"Fine," Samuel said. "But you stay behind me. And the SECOND we reach the town center, you ride home. Understood?"

"Understood."

We rode toward Concord.

Together.
