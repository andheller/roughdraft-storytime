# Chapter 5: History Remembers... Someone Else

Six months later.

I was helping my mother hang laundry when Mrs. Patterson came running over with a newspaper.

"Have you SEEN this?" she gasped.

It was a poem. A brand new poem about the midnight ride, spreading through all the colonies. I read it eagerly, expecting to see... well, something about what actually happened.

Paul Revere's name was everywhere.

William Dawes was mentioned once.

Samuel Prescott was mentioned once.

I was mentioned... not at all.

"That's not how it happened," I said, staring at the newspaper. "Mr. Revere got CAPTURED. He never made it to Concord!"

"Well," Mrs. Patterson said diplomatically, "poems don't always get the details right."

**True Historical Fact**: For many years after the Revolution, Paul Revere wasn't particularly famous for his midnight ride. He was known as a silversmith and an engraver. Then, in 1861—almost 100 years later!—Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem called "Paul Revere's Ride." The poem made Revere incredibly famous, but it got a LOT of details wrong:

- It barely mentioned William Dawes, who rode with Revere
- It didn't mention Samuel Prescott at all, even though HE was the one who actually reached Concord
- It said Revere saw the lantern signal from across the river, but actually Revere helped PLAN the signal before he left
- The poem made it sound like Revere rode alone, when really it was a group effort

History is weird like that. Sometimes the wrong people get the credit.

I went to visit Samuel a few weeks after I saw the poem. He was back in his medical practice, treating sore throats and broken bones like nothing had happened.

"Does it bother you?" I asked. "That nobody remembers you were there?"

He looked up from the splint he was making. "Hmm?"

"The poem. It's all about Mr. Revere. But YOU finished the ride. I was there! I SAW you!"

Samuel smiled and went back to his splint. "Mercy, I didn't ride that night to get famous. I rode because people needed to be warned."

"But—"

"History is full of people who did important things and never got credit. That's not why we do them."

I crossed my arms. "Well, I think it's unfair."

"Life often is."

He tied off the splint and looked at me. "Besides, you know what really happened. I know. Everyone who was there that night knows. And most importantly—the people of Concord know. They had time to hide their weapons. They had time to gather the militia. That's what mattered."

I thought about it.

He was kind of right.

But also, it was STILL unfair.

That night, I sat at my desk with a candle and a piece of paper.

If history wasn't going to remember what really happened, maybe I should write it down myself.

*My name is Mercy Prescott*, I wrote. *I am eleven years old. And this is the true story of the midnight ride.*

I wrote for hours. About the pie dish. About Buttercup. About the two lanterns and the British patrols and the chaos in Concord. About my cousin Samuel, who actually finished the ride. About me, following along on an elderly horse because I was too stubborn to go home.

When I finished, I had twelve pages.

"It's probably terrible," I told Buttercup the next morning. "Nobody will ever read it."

Buttercup ate her oats.

"But at least it's TRUE."

Years passed.

The war continued. There were more battles—Bunker Hill, Trenton, Yorktown. I was too young to fight, but I helped where I could. Rolling bandages. Carrying messages. Helping my mother make uniforms for the soldiers.

In 1783, when I was nineteen years old, the war finally ended.

We won.

We actually won.

The British surrendered, and the United States of America became a real country, with a real government and a real Constitution and everything.

I kept my story—those twelve pages I wrote the night I got angry about the poem. I added to it over the years. Updated it. Made sure the details were right.

And when I was very old—an old woman with gray hair and creaky joints—I showed it to my grandchildren.

"You did ALL of this?" my granddaughter asked, eyes wide.

"I was just trying to return a pie dish."

"But you helped save the Revolution!"

"I helped a little. Lots of people helped. That's how revolutions work—everyone does a little, and together it becomes a lot."

My granddaughter looked at the pages thoughtfully. "Can I keep this story?"

"Of course. Just promise me something."

"What?"

I smiled at her—the same smile Samuel had given me, all those years ago, when I'd asked if it bothered him that history forgot.

"Promise me you'll tell people the truth. That revolutions aren't made by one hero on a horse. They're made by thousands of ordinary people—farmers and doctors and eleven-year-old girls—who decide that something is worth fighting for."

She promised.

And maybe, someday, she told her children. And they told their children.

And maybe—just maybe—you're reading this right now.

If you are, here's what I want you to remember:

History belongs to everyone who lived it. Not just the famous names. Not just the people in the poems. EVERYONE.

Even the ones who were just trying to return a pie dish.

## Did You Know?

**Real Historical Facts from This Story:**

1. **Paul Revere WAS captured!** British soldiers stopped him in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and took his horse. He never made it to Concord.

2. **Dr. Samuel Prescott finished the ride.** He was the only one of the three riders (Revere, Dawes, and Prescott) who actually reached Concord to warn the town.

3. **William Dawes fell off his horse** while trying to escape the British patrol. He had to walk home.

4. **The people of Concord really did hide their weapons** in creative places—barns, fields, false walls, and even a chicken coop.

## Try This at Home!

1. **Write your own "forgotten hero" story.** Think of someone in history who did something important but didn't get famous. Write THEIR story!

2. **Interview an older family member** about something they lived through. What stories might be forgotten if nobody writes them down?

3. **Create a timeline** of the real events of April 18-19, 1775. Who was where, and when?
