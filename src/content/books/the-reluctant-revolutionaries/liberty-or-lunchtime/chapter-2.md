# Chapter 2: Valley Forge is the Worst

A year had passed since the Delaware crossing, and I was STILL with the army.

I'm ten years old now, which means I've had ten winters, and I can say with complete certainty that Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in the winter of 1777, is the absolute WORST.

Here are the things I am currently experiencing:
1. Cold. So cold. Colder than cold.
2. Hungry. The soldiers keep joking about "fire cakes," which are just flour and water cooked over a fire. They are not as fun as they sound.
3. Bored. There's nothing to do except be cold and hungry.

I'm supposed to be in Philadelphia. I'm supposed to be eating my mom's apple pie. Instead, I'm STILL stuck at an army camp with Uncle Harold, because apparently saving a general at Trenton made me "too valuable" to send home.

"But Uncle Harold," I had begged after the battle, "I want to go HOME."

"The war's not over yet, Theo."

"It's been a YEAR!"

"And it might be another year. Or three. Wars take time."

So here I was. Valley Forge. Winter. Miserable.

"Theo!" Uncle Harold called from across the camp. "I need you to deliver this soup to the officers' tent!"

I looked at the pot of soup. It was thin and watery and had maybe three pieces of actual vegetable in it.

"This is soup?" I asked.

"It's what we've got," Uncle Harold said. "Now go. The generals are waiting."

I trudged through the snow, carefully carrying the pot. My shoes had holes in them. My coat was too thin. A soldier walked past me and sneezed, and I was pretty sure he hadn't eaten in two days.

"I want to go home," I muttered for the four hundredth time that week.

The officers' tent was the biggest one in camp. I pushed through the flap and immediately tripped on a loose rope.

The soup went flying.

And landed directly on the boots of a very tall man in a fancy blue coat.

Time froze. I stared at the soup dripping down his boots. He stared at me. Everyone in the tent stared at both of us.

"I am SO sorry!" I scrambled to wipe off his boots with my sleeve. "I didn't mean to— the rope was— I can—"

"Stop." The man's voice was deep and calm.

I stopped.

"Stand up."

I stood up.

The tall man looked down at me. He had a tired face and worried eyes, but he wasn't angry. Instead, he almost smiled.

"At least the soup was warm," he said. "My feet were freezing."

A few officers chuckled nervously. I just stared, because I had suddenly realized who I was looking at.

This was General George Washington. The same man who had pinned a medal on me after the Delaware crossing.

And I had just dumped soup on his shoes.

"I'm sorry, sir," I whispered. "I really didn't mean to."

"I know." Then his eyes narrowed. "Wait. Theo Finch? The boy from the Delaware?"

"Yes, sir." I wanted to disappear into the floor.

"The wagon wheel boy!" An officer nearby started laughing. "I heard about you! Saved General Sullivan!"

"It was an accident," I muttered.

Washington looked amused. "Well, Theo Finch, it seems you've found me again. Go get some rest. And perhaps walk more carefully with the next pot."

I practically ran out of that tent.

---

That night, I couldn't sleep. Partly because it was cold (obviously), but mostly because I couldn't stop thinking about spilling soup on George Washington.

My mom would be mortified. My dad would laugh. I just wanted to disappear.

Around midnight, I snuck out of my tent to walk around. Sometimes walking helps when I can't sleep. Also, it's slightly warmer to move than to lie still.

The camp was quiet except for the guards and the occasional cough from the soldiers' tents. I wandered toward the edge of camp, where the trees started.

That's when I heard voices.

Quiet voices. Speaking in the shadows.

"The supply wagons arrive Thursday," someone whispered. "That's when we strike."

"How many guards?"

"Only four. It'll be easy."

I froze. These weren't American accents. These were... British?

I peeked around a tree. Two men in dark cloaks stood in the shadows, just outside the camp's edge. One was drawing something in the dirt—a map, maybe?

"General Howe will be pleased," one said. "Steal their supplies, and this pathetic rebellion ends by spring."

Spies. British spies. Planning to steal the army's food.

I should have run. I should have quietly snuck away and told a guard. Instead, I stepped on a twig.

CRACK.

Both men spun around.

"WHO'S THERE?!"

I did what any sensible ten-year-old would do: I ran.

I ran faster than I've ever run in my life. Behind me, I heard shouting and crashing as the spies chased me through the dark woods.

"HELP!" I screamed. "SPIES! THERE ARE SPIES!"

I burst out of the trees and crashed directly into a tent.

George Washington's tent.

Again.

I tumbled through the flap and rolled across the floor, coming to a stop at someone's feet. I looked up. Washington stood there, still dressed, holding a candle.

"Young Theo," he said calmly, as if children crashed into his tent every night. "You seem distressed."

"SPIES!" I gasped. "In the woods! British! They're planning to steal the supplies!"

Washington's expression changed instantly. He strode to the tent entrance and called out to the guards. Within minutes, soldiers were streaming into the woods with torches.

They caught both spies.

The next morning, I stood in front of George Washington again. This time, I hadn't spilled anything on him.

"Theodore Finch," Washington said formally, "last night you single-handedly uncovered a British plot that could have starved this entire army."

"I just heard them talking," I said. "I didn't really do anything."

"You ran. You warned us. You saved lives." He pinned a second medal on my coat, right next to the first one. "You're a hero. Again."

I looked at my two medals. I looked at Washington. I looked at the medals again.

"With all due respect, sir," I said, "I just want to go home and eat pie."

Washington almost smiled again. That seemed to be his thing—almost smiling.

"Theo Finch," he said thoughtfully. "First the Delaware, now this. You remind me of myself at your age. Except I liked pie less."

"That seems impossible, sir."

This time, he actually did smile. Just a little.

"Get some rest, hero. I suspect this war will find you again."

---

I went back to Uncle Harold's tent, clutching my second medal.

"I don't want to be a hero," I told him. "I want to go HOME."

Uncle Harold just laughed and handed me a fire cake.

"Eat your breakfast, hero."

I bit into the tasteless, awful fire cake and thought about my mom's apple pie.

Three hundred miles away.

Might as well be on the moon.

And somewhere deep in my gut, I had a terrible feeling that General Washington was right.

This war wasn't done with me yet.
