# Chapter 2: The Midnight Ride I Didn't Sign Up For

Spring finally came to Valley Forge, and I had a new plan: Stay invisible.

No more stumbling into generals. No more accidentally catching spies. Just feed the horses, stay quiet, and hopefully everyone would forget I existed until the war ended and I could go home.

My new job was perfect for invisibility. I worked in the stables, feeding and brushing the horses. Horses don't ask you to be a hero. Horses just want oats and head scratches.

"You're my favorite part of this whole war," I told a brown mare named Biscuit.

Biscuit snorted and ate more hay.

See? Perfect job.

Everything was going great until the night of April 15th.

I was moving Biscuit from one stall to another. Simple task. Even I couldn't mess it up.

"Come on, girl." I climbed onto her back (the ground was muddy and I didn't want to walk through it). "Just a short ride to the other stable."

Biscuit walked calmly for about three seconds.

Then a soldier behind us dropped a metal bucket with a massive CLANG.

Biscuit panicked.

She reared up, nearly throwing me off. I grabbed her mane. She shot forward like a cannonball.

"STOP!" I screamed. "BISCUIT, STOP!"

Biscuit did not stop.

We galloped past the officers' tents. Past the guard posts. Past the edge of camp. Into the dark countryside beyond.

"SOMEBODY HELP!"

Nobody helped.

---

I have no idea how long we rode. It felt like hours. Biscuit ran like something was chasing her, even though nothing was chasing her except maybe her own fear of buckets.

Finally, FINALLY, she slowed down outside a tavern in a small town I didn't recognize.

I slid off her back, shaking. "What is WRONG with you?!"

Biscuit just snorted.

The tavern door opened, and a man in a Continental uniform hurried out.

"Finally!" he exclaimed. "I've been waiting for hours! Do you have the message?"

I stared at him. "What message?"

His face fell. "You're the dispatch rider, aren't you? From Valley Forge? With General Washington's orders?"

"I'm a kid who feeds horses. One of them ran away with me."

The man looked at Biscuit. He looked at me. He looked back at Biscuit.

"That's... that's General Washington's fastest horse. The one reserved for urgent messages."

I looked at Biscuit. Biscuit looked at me, completely innocent.

"Of course it is," I muttered.

Just then, we heard hoofbeats. Another rider appeared from the darkness—a soldier, red-faced and exhausted.

"Did the message get through?!" he wheezed, pulling up next to us.

"What message?!" I shouted.

The soldier reached into his saddlebag and pulled out... nothing. His eyes went wide.

"It's gone! The dispatch must have fallen out when—" He stopped. He stared at Biscuit. "Wait. Is that Washington's horse? Did YOU take the message?!"

"I didn't take anything! I don't know what's happening!"

Then I felt something crinkle in my pocket.

I reached in and pulled out a folded piece of paper with a wax seal. It must have fallen in when I grabbed Biscuit's saddlebag for balance.

"Is... is this it?"

The man from the tavern snatched it, read it quickly, and his whole face changed.

"Troop movements! British positions! This is exactly what we needed!" He looked at me with something like awe. "Son, you just delivered one of the most important messages of the war."

"I didn't deliver anything! The horse ran away!"

"Modesty!" The soldier beamed. "Just like General Washington described you. 'The humble hero.'"

"I'M NOT HUMBLE, I'M CONFUSED!"

Nobody listened.

---

The next morning, I rode back to Valley Forge (slowly, with a MUCH calmer Biscuit) and found Uncle Harold waiting for me.

"Where have you BEEN?!" he demanded.

"I don't want to talk about it."

"You're all anyone can talk about! 'The Midnight Rider'! They're saying you rode through the night to deliver a crucial message!"

"A HORSE ran away with me."

"You saved an entire regiment! General Washington wants to see you!"

"I DON'T WANT TO SEE GENERAL WASHINGTON!"

But of course, I didn't get a choice.

---

Once again, I stood in front of George Washington. He looked at me like I was a puzzle he couldn't quite figure out.

"Theodore Finch," he said slowly. "The same boy who caught the spies. Now you've delivered a message that helped us outmaneuver the British."

"Sir, I didn't mean to—"

"You rode twenty miles in the dark. Alone."

"The horse—"

"Through potentially dangerous territory."

"She wouldn't STOP—"

"With vital intelligence that you protected with your own life."

I gave up.

"Yes, sir. That's exactly what happened."

Washington nodded gravely. "I'm adding you to the official list of dispatch riders."

My heart sank. "Sir, please, I'm just here to help my uncle cook. I feed horses. I'm not a soldier."

"You're not a soldier," Washington agreed. "You're something more useful. You're lucky." He handed me another medal. "Luck wins wars, Theo Finch."

---

That night, I sat in Uncle Harold's tent, staring at my two medals.

"I don't WANT to be lucky," I told him. "I want to be HOME."

Uncle Harold patted my shoulder. "Eat your dinner, dispatch rider."

"I'm not a dispatch rider! I'm a kid who wants PIE!"

He handed me another fire cake.

"Pie isn't on the menu."

I bit into the fire cake and thought about how much I hated Valley Forge, horses, midnight rides, and pretty much everything except the idea of my mom's kitchen, three hundred miles away.

Two medals now. Two completely accidental heroic acts.

And deep down, I had a sinking feeling this wasn't over.

History wasn't done with me.

Not even close.
