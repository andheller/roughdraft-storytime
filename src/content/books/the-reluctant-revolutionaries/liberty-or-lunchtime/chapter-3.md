# Chapter 3: I Was Just Hiding in That Boat

December 25th, 1776. Christmas Day.

You know what I wanted for Christmas? To go home. To eat pie. To never see another soldier, horse, or important military message ever again.

You know what I got?

The Delaware River. At night. In a boat I didn't mean to be in.

Let me explain.

---

It started that morning. Uncle Harold had a new assignment for me.

"The whole army is moving tonight," he said. "Secret operation. I need you to help me carry cooking supplies to the boats."

"Boats?" I perked up. "Are we going home?"

"We're going to New Jersey."

"That's the wrong direction!"

Uncle Harold ignored me. "Start loading those crates."

I spent all morning hauling pots and pans and bags of flour to the riverbank. It was freezing. The river was full of floating ice chunks. And my shoes STILL had holes in them.

By afternoon, I was exhausted. The boats sat along the shore, waiting. Nobody was supposed to board until nightfall.

That's when I had what I thought was a brilliant idea.

"If I hide in one of those boats," I reasoned, "I can take a nap. By the time anyone finds me, we'll be in New Jersey, and it'll be too late to make me work."

I know. I KNOW. But I was tired and cold and absolutely desperate for a break from being "The Hero" everyone kept calling me.

I snuck onto the closest boat—a big, flat-bottomed one—and buried myself under some canvas tarps near the front. Within minutes, I was asleep.

---

I woke up to the sound of oars.

And shouting. And ice cracking. And a LOT of movement.

"Steady, men! Keep rowing!"

I peeked out from under the tarp.

The boat was in the MIDDLE OF THE RIVER. Surrounded by giant chunks of floating ice. Soldiers rowed on every side, grunting and straining against the current.

And standing at the front of a nearby boat, looking extremely dramatic against the dark sky, was General George Washington.

Oh no.

Oh no no no.

I was in the middle of the CROSSING OF THE DELAWARE.

I ducked back under the tarp, heart pounding. Maybe if I stayed hidden, nobody would notice me. Maybe I could just stay here until we reached New Jersey and sneak away.

THUMP.

A boot landed right next to my head.

"What's under that tarp?"

Before I could do anything, someone yanked the canvas away. I found myself staring up at a very surprised soldier.

"It's a KID!"

"What's a kid doing here?!"

"Who let a child on this boat?!"

The commotion caught Washington's attention. He looked over from his boat, squinting through the darkness.

Then, impossibly, he smiled.

"FINCH!" he called across the water. "I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN!"

Everyone turned to stare at me. Twenty soldiers, frozen oars in hand, all looking at the nine-year-old who had accidentally invaded their top-secret military operation.

"I was just taking a nap," I said weakly.

---

They couldn't send me back—we were already halfway across—so I got drafted into helping.

"Bail water!" a soldier ordered, shoving a bucket at me.

I bailed. Water was sloshing into the boat from every side, and the chunks of ice kept bumping into us like frozen battering rams.

"This is the worst Christmas ever!" I shouted.

"KEEP BAILING!"

I bailed harder.

We reached the far shore around three in the morning. I was soaked. My hands were blistered from the bucket. And I was pretty sure I had ice in places ice should never be.

But we'd made it.

"All troops, form up!" Washington commanded as the last boats landed. "We march on Trenton!"

Wait. March?

"I thought we were just crossing the river!" I said to a nearby soldier.

He laughed. "We're crossing the river to ATTACK the enemy camp. Surprise assault. Merry Christmas to the British."

This was not what I signed up for. This was the OPPOSITE of what I signed up for.

---

I'm not going to describe the whole battle. Partly because it was dark and confusing, and partly because I spent most of it hiding behind a wagon.

But here's what happened: While I was hiding, I noticed something. Three British soldiers were sneaking around the side of the main fight, heading toward a building where, I later learned, important American officers were stationed.

I could have stayed hidden. I SHOULD have stayed hidden.

Instead, I grabbed a loose wagon wheel and threw it.

I don't know WHAT I was thinking.

The wheel rolled across the icy street, hit a rock, bounced, and slammed directly into the lead British soldier's legs. He went down. The other two tripped over him.

American soldiers saw the commotion and captured all three.

Turns out, they were trying to capture an American general.

And I had stopped them. With a wagon wheel.

---

After the battle (we won, by the way—Merry Christmas), Washington found me sitting on a barrel, staring at nothing.

"Finch," he said. "You were on that boat."

"I was just taking a nap," I repeated. "I didn't mean to be there."

"And yet there you were." He looked at me thoughtfully. "You saved General Sullivan. With a wagon wheel."

"It was an accident."

"Was the crossing an accident?"

"YES!"

"Was catching those spies an accident?"

"YES!"

"Was the midnight ride an accident?"

"THE HORSE RAN AWAY!"

Washington nodded slowly. "Theo, some people run toward danger because they're brave. Some people find danger because they're unlucky. But you..." He pinned ANOTHER medal on my coat. "You find danger because history needs you there."

"I don't WANT history to need me!"

"None of us want what history gives us." He patted my shoulder. "Get some sleep. You've earned it."

---

Uncle Harold found me an hour later, asleep on a pile of flour sacks.

"I heard you crossed the Delaware," he said.

"I was NAPPING."

"In a boat."

"I didn't know it would MOVE."

He handed me something wrapped in cloth. I unwrapped it. Inside was a small pastry—not pie, but close.

"Where did you get this?"

"A baker in Trenton. Said any kid who stopped an enemy soldier with a wagon wheel deserved a treat."

I bit into the pastry. It wasn't my mom's pie. But it was the best thing I'd eaten in months.

"I want to go home, Uncle Harold."

"I know."

"I really, really want to go home."

"I know." He sat beside me. "But the war needs you, Theo Finch."

I looked at my three medals. Three accidents. Three moments of being exactly where history needed someone to be.

"The war needs to find someone else," I grumbled.

But deep down, I knew it wouldn't.

History had found me.

And it wasn't letting go.
