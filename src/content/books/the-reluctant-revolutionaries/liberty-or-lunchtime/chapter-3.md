# Chapter 3: The Midnight Ride I Didn't Sign Up For

Spring finally came to Valley Forge. The snow melted. The sun appeared. And for one beautiful moment, I thought my luck might finally change.

I was wrong.

"Theo!" Uncle Harold shook me awake. "The army is marching! Get up!"

I groaned. Two months had passed since I'd accidentally caught the British spies. Two months of fire cakes and cold nights and people calling me "the wagon wheel hero" (which I hated) and "spy-catcher Finch" (which I hated more).

Now we were marching somewhere. Again.

"Where are we going?" I asked, stumbling out of the tent.

"Philadelphia."

I sat up so fast I almost fell over. "PHILADELPHIA? My home? We're going HOME?"

"The British are abandoning the city," Uncle Harold explained. "We're marching to take it back."

Home. I was finally going home.

---

The march took days. I walked until my feet were blistered, then walked some more. But I didn't complain. Every step brought me closer to my mom's apple pie.

On the third day, something happened that changed everything.

We were passing through a small town when an officer approached Uncle Harold.

"Harold Finch? I need to borrow your nephew."

I froze. Nothing good ever started with "I need to borrow your nephew."

"For what?" Uncle Harold asked suspiciously.

"General Washington needs a message delivered. It's urgent. And Theo is..." the officer paused, "well-known for getting into the right place at the right time."

"I don't want to be well-known!" I protested.

But it was too late. Within an hour, I was on a horse, clutching a sealed letter, with strict instructions to deliver it to General Lafayette, who was stationed somewhere ahead of the main army.

"Just follow the road," the officer said. "You'll find him by nightfall."

"I've never ridden a horse alone before!"

"Then this will be educational."

I was really starting to hate that word.

---

The horse—his name was apparently Thunder, which was ironic because he walked slower than a sleepy turtle—and I made our way down the road as the sun set.

I was nervous. Really nervous. British patrols were still in the area. I was a ten-year-old kid on a slow horse carrying what was probably important military information.

What could go wrong?

Everything. Everything could go wrong.

And then it did.

A group of soldiers appeared on the road ahead. At first, I thought they were American—but then I saw the red coats.

British soldiers. A whole patrol of them. Heading straight toward me.

I yanked on Thunder's reins. "Turn around! TURN AROUND!"

Thunder, who was approximately one thousand years old and possibly deaf, kept walking forward.

"THUNDER! PLEASE!"

One of the British soldiers spotted me.

"OI! STOP THERE!"

That's when Thunder finally decided to move.

He bolted.

Not away from the soldiers. Not back the way we came. No, Thunder decided the best direction was THROUGH THE WOODS, off the road, into complete darkness, with me holding on for dear life.

"STOP! THUNDER! PLEASE STOP!"

Thunder did not stop.

Branches slapped my face. My coat caught on a bush and ripped. The letter flew out of my pocket and—

Oh no. The letter.

I grabbed for it and missed. It disappeared into the darkness behind me.

Thunder kept running. Running and running and running until finally, finally, he burst out of the woods and onto another road.

Where he immediately stopped, looked around calmly, and started eating grass like nothing had happened.

I sat there, shaking, trying to figure out what had just happened.

I had lost the letter. I had lost General Washington's urgent message to Lafayette.

I was going to be in SO much trouble.

---

I spent the next two hours stumbling through the dark, trying to find the letter. I found three rocks, one angry owl, and what might have been a skunk (I ran away before I could confirm).

No letter.

Finally, I gave up and kept riding—well, slowly walking—toward wherever Lafayette was supposed to be.

I found the camp just before dawn. A guard stopped me at the entrance.

"I need to see General Lafayette," I said, trying to sound important. "I have a message from General Washington."

"Where's the message?"

"I... may have lost it."

The guard stared at me. "You LOST a message from General Washington?"

"My horse panicked! There were British soldiers! It's a whole thing!"

They took me to Lafayette anyway. He was younger than I expected—maybe in his twenties—with a friendly face and a French accent.

"You are the famous Theo Finch?" he asked, smiling. "Washington has written to me about you."

"I'm really not famous," I said. "And I lost your letter. I'm so sorry."

"What did the letter say?"

"I don't know. It was sealed."

Lafayette thought for a moment. "Then tell me what you DO know. What have you seen?"

So I told him everything—about the march, about the British patrol on the road, about Thunder's insane run through the woods.

When I mentioned where I'd seen the British patrol, Lafayette's eyes went wide.

"That road—you're sure?"

"Yes?"

"That's not where our scouts said they would be. They're repositioning." He turned to an aide. "Send word to Washington immediately. The British are moving east, not north."

Twenty minutes later, I was eating breakfast when Lafayette found me again.

"Young Theo," he said, "your lost letter was a routine update. Not important. But the information you brought back—the British position—that may have just saved our army from walking into a trap."

"But I LOST THE LETTER."

"Yes," Lafayette grinned. "And in doing so, you discovered something far more valuable. Your midnight ride was more successful than you know."

---

When I finally rejoined Uncle Harold two days later, I found General Washington waiting for me.

"Theo Finch," Washington said, his eyes twinkling. "You lost my letter."

"I'm sorry, sir."

"And in losing it, you discovered the British army's position and prevented what could have been a disastrous ambush."

"I... yes?"

He pinned a third medal on my coat.

"Three accidents," I said, staring at my medals. "Three times I messed up and somehow helped anyway."

"Perhaps the accidents are the point," Washington said. "Perhaps history knows what it's doing, even when you don't."

"That seems unlikely, sir."

"Most of history seems unlikely, Theo Finch." He patted my shoulder. "Keep accidentally stumbling into heroism. You're rather good at it."

---

That night, Uncle Harold found me sitting alone, looking at my three medals.

"We're almost to Philadelphia," he said.

"I know."

"You'll see your mom soon. Eat that pie you keep talking about."

"I know." I touched the medals. "Uncle Harold, do you think the war will ever be over?"

"Eventually. All wars end."

"And what happens to accidental heroes when the war ends?"

Uncle Harold smiled. "They go home. They eat pie. They live their lives."

"That sounds nice."

"It does." He sat beside me. "But you're not done yet, Theo Finch. I can feel it. This war has more plans for you."

I looked at the stars and thought about pie.

Three medals. Three accidents. Three moments of being exactly where I wasn't supposed to be.

And somewhere in the distance, Philadelphia waited.

Home.

I just had to survive long enough to get there.
