# Your Turn! The Backyard Revolution

Hey! Theo here.

So you finished reading about my ridiculous adventures? Good. Now it's YOUR turn.

That's right—you can have your very own American Revolution right in your backyard. No time travel required. No accidentally ending up in boats. Just you, your imagination, and maybe some sticks.

Here's your official guide:

---

## GATHER YOUR ARMY

First, you need troops. Here are some options:

**Best options:**
- Brothers, sisters, cousins, friends
- Neighbors who look bored
- That one kid who always wants to play whatever you're playing

**Acceptable options:**
- Stuffed animals (they make excellent soldiers who never complain)
- Action figures (mix different types for historical inaccuracy and maximum fun)
- Pets (dogs make good cavalry, cats make terrible soldiers but excellent spies)

**Last resort:**
- Imaginary friends (they always agree with your battle plans)

## WEAPONS OF MILD DESTRUCTION

The Revolution had muskets and cannons. You have:

**Stick Muskets**
Find a good stick. About arm-length. Congratulations, you now have a musket. Pew pew!

*Pro tip: The best musket sticks are slightly curved. Nobody knows why, but it's true.*

**Sock Grenades**
Roll up some old socks into balls. These are your grenades. Throw them at enemy fortifications (the couch, a cardboard box, your little brother).

*Warning: Retrieve socks before Mom notices they're gone.*

**Pinecone Cannonballs**
If you have pinecones, you have artillery. Roll them across the ground while making explosion sounds.

*Do NOT throw pinecones at people. Real cannonballs didn't hit people in the face on purpose. Usually.*

**Water Balloon Surprise Attacks**
For summer battles only. Perfect for re-enacting that time Washington surprised the British at Trenton.

## FAMOUS BATTLES YOU CAN RE-ENACT

### VALLEY FORGE (WINTER EDITION)
**What you need:** Blankets, pillows, complaints

Build a fort out of blankets and pillows. Sit inside for ten minutes pretending to be cold and hungry. Complain a lot. Eat crackers and pretend they're fire cakes.

After ten minutes, declare victory because you survived.

*Historical accuracy rating: Very accurate, except for the part where you have actual food*

### CROSSING THE DELAWARE (SUMMER EDITION)
**What you need:** A wagon, a wheelbarrow, or any vehicle with wheels

Have someone pull you across the yard while you stand dramatically. Bonus points if you point at the horizon like Washington.

If you don't have a wagon, just wade through a kiddie pool while making serious faces.

*Historical accuracy rating: Medium. The real Delaware was colder.*

### THE MIDNIGHT RIDE (ANYTIME EDITION)
**What you need:** A bike, scooter, or very fast running shoes

Ride/run around the yard shouting "THE BRITISH ARE COMING!"

Your family will probably tell you to quiet down. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT.

*Historical accuracy rating: Surprisingly accurate*

### THE BATTLE OF YORKTOWN (EPIC FINALE EDITION)
**What you need:** Everything. All your weapons. All your troops.

This is the big one. Set up your enemy (stuffed animals, action figures) behind a barrier. Position your army. Make lots of cannon sounds.

After five minutes of imaginary explosions, have the enemy wave a white flag (a sock works great).

Celebrate by eating snacks.

*Historical accuracy rating: Pretty good, honestly*

## THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE (FROM BEDTIME)

Want to really feel like a Revolutionary? Write your own Declaration of Independence!

Here's a template:

> **THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF [YOUR NAME]**
>
> When in the course of childhood events, it becomes necessary for a kid to dissolve the bedtime rules...
>
> We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all children are created equal, and they deserve the right to stay up late, eat more dessert, and have longer recess.
>
> WE THEREFORE DECLARE that bedtime should be moved to [write whatever time you want].
>
> Signed,
> [Your name], Age [your age], Defender of Liberty and Late-Night Snacks

*Important note: Your parents may not recognize this document as legally binding. Results may vary.*

## VICTORY FEAST

No revolution is complete without a celebration!

Theo's recommendations:

- **Apple pie** (the official pie of heroes who didn't mean to be heroes)
- **Any pie** (Theo doesn't discriminate)
- **Cookies** (if pie isn't available)
- **Whatever's in the fridge** (revolutions make you hungry)

## THEO'S FINAL ADVICE

Look, I accidentally became a war hero, and all I wanted was to go home and eat pie. But you know what? I learned some things along the way:

1. **Sometimes you end up somewhere you didn't plan.** That's okay. Make the best of it.

2. **Being brave doesn't mean you're not scared.** It means you do stuff anyway. Even if "doing stuff" means throwing a wagon wheel at someone.

3. **History is made by regular people.** Kings and generals get all the credit, but it's the kids hiding in boats who really make a difference.

4. **Pie is always worth fighting for.** This is the most important lesson.

Now go have your own adventures. Make your own history.

And if you accidentally end up as a hero?

Well, at least you'll have a good story to tell.

**P.S.** - If a horse ever runs away with you, just hold on tight. It'll stop eventually. Probably.

**P.P.S.** - Don't actually hide in boats. Trust me on this one.

**P.P.P.S.** - Okay, maybe hide in boats a LITTLE. Life's more fun that way.
