# Chapter 4: The Pie at the End of the War

October 1781. Yorktown, Virginia.

I am thirteen years old now. I have spent FOUR YEARS accidentally being a hero.

Four years. Four very long, very cold, very pie-less years.

Do you want to know how many medals I have? Seven. SEVEN medals for things I didn't mean to do. I've been given awards for:
- Crossing the Delaware (napping mishap)
- Catching spies at Valley Forge (accident)
- A midnight ride to Lafayette (horse ran away)
- Three more message deliveries (wrong place, wrong time, every time)
- And one medal for "general heroism," which I think they gave me because they ran out of specific reasons

I keep all seven medals in a sock. I don't want to look at them.

Here's the thing about Yorktown: Everyone knew this was it. The big battle. The British were trapped between our army and the French navy. If we won here, the war was basically over.

And I had a plan. A simple, perfect plan:

**STAY. HIDDEN.**

No boats this time. No horses. No wandering into the woods at night. I found a supply tent far from the fighting, crawled inside, and wrapped myself in blankets.

"Nobody will find me here," I whispered to myself. "The war will end without me. I'll go home. I'll eat pie. Everything will be fine."

I should have known better.

---

The battle started with cannons. Even from my hiding spot, I could hear them BOOMING across the field. The tent shook with every explosion.

Then someone shouted, "Move the supplies forward! The front lines need ammunition!"

The tent flap opened. Soldiers rushed in and started grabbing crates.

"This one too!" someone yelled, grabbing the corner of MY tent.

Wait. They weren't just taking supplies.

They were moving THE WHOLE TENT.

"HEY!" I scrambled out from under the blankets. "WAIT!"

Too late. The tent was already being dragged forward, with me inside, toward the front lines of the Battle of Yorktown.

"STOP! I'M IN HERE!"

Nobody heard me over the cannons.

---

When the tent finally stopped moving, I peeked outside.

I was approximately fifty feet from actual combat.

British soldiers behind fortified walls. American soldiers firing muskets. Cannons EVERYWHERE.

"This is fine," I said to myself. "This is totally fine. I'll just stay in this tent until—"

CRASH!

A cannonball tore through the top of the tent and exploded out the other side. I dove flat on the ground as canvas and supplies rained down around me.

The tent was destroyed. I was lying in the middle of a battlefield with no cover.

"FINCH?!"

I looked up. A soldier I recognized from Valley Forge was staring at me in disbelief.

"What are you DOING here?!"

"I WAS HIDING!"

"IN A SUPPLY TENT?"

"IT SEEMED SAFE!"

Another cannonball whistled overhead. We both hit the dirt.

"Get to the command post!" the soldier shouted. "It's safer there!"

I ran. I ran faster than I'd ever run (which, after four years of accidentally running from danger, was pretty fast). Somehow, I made it to the command post in one piece.

And there, standing in the middle of organized chaos, directing troops and studying maps, was General George Washington.

He looked up. He saw me.

He didn't even seem surprised.

"FINCH!" he called out. "I was wondering when you'd appear!"

"I was HIDING, sir!"

"And yet here you are. At the decisive battle of the war." He almost smiled. That was still his thing—almost smiling. "Come. Stand with me. You should see this."

---

I don't know how long the battle lasted. Hours? Days? At some point, I stopped being scared and just started being tired.

But then something changed.

A British officer appeared on the walls, waving a white flag.

The cannons went quiet.

Everyone went quiet.

"They're surrendering," Washington said softly. "It's over."

I watched as the British officers came out to discuss terms. I watched as Washington and his generals stepped forward to accept the surrender.

And I stood there in my torn clothes and muddy boots, with seven accidental medals in my sock, realizing that the war was actually, finally, truly over.

"I can go home now?" I whispered.

Washington heard me. He turned around.

"Yes, Theo Finch. You can go home." He walked over and, to my complete shock, shook my hand. "Your country owes you a debt."

"I didn't do anything, sir. Everything was an accident."

"I know. That's what makes you special." He reached into his coat and pulled out one final medal. "This one is for being exactly who you are. The most reluctant hero I've ever known."

I looked at the medal. It was bigger than the others. Fancier. Probably important.

I put it in the sock with the rest.

"Thank you, sir. Can I go eat pie now?"

Washington laughed. An actual laugh. After four years, I finally made George Washington actually laugh.

"Go home, Theo. Eat all the pie you want. You've earned it."

---

Two weeks later, I walked through the door of my house in Philadelphia.

My mom was in the kitchen. She turned around. She saw me.

"THEO!"

She ran across the room and hugged me so hard I thought my ribs would break.

"You're back! You're finally back!" She was crying and laughing at the same time. "I heard stories—everyone told stories about you—the spies, the ride, the boat—"

"Mom. MOM." I pulled back and looked her in the eyes. "Is there any pie?"

She stared at me for a moment. Then she started laughing.

"I've been keeping one warm. Every day since I heard the war was ending." She wiped her eyes. "Apple. Your favorite."

She brought out the pie. It was golden and perfect and steaming and the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

I ate three slices. Then a fourth. Then I may have lost count.

"Theo," my mom said, watching me eat, "what was it like? Being a hero?"

I thought about Valley Forge. The midnight ride. The boat I didn't mean to be in. The tent that got dragged to a battlefield.

"I wasn't a hero, Mom. Everything that happened was an accident." I took another bite of pie. "I just kept being in the wrong place at the wrong time."

"Or," she said softly, "the right place at the right time."

I didn't have an answer for that. So I ate more pie.

---

That night, I lay in my own bed for the first time in four years. A real bed. With real blankets. In my own room.

Tomorrow, I'd have to figure out what to do with my eight medals. Tomorrow, I'd have to explain to everyone that I wasn't actually a hero.

But tonight?

Tonight I was home. I had pie in my stomach and blankets around me and nobody was asking me to catch spies or ride horses or cross rivers.

"The Accidental Adventures of Theo Finch," I said to the ceiling. "Finally over."

I closed my eyes and smiled.

History was done with me.

At least, I really, REALLY hoped so.

**THE END**

*...Or is it? After all, there's still the War of 1812 coming up. And Theo DOES have a habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time...*

*Just kidding. Theo ate pie and lived happily ever after.*

*Probably.*
