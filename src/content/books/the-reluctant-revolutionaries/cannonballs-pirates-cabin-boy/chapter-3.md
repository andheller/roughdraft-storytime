# Chapter 3: Pirates Are Supposed to Be the Bad Guys

We dropped anchor near Barataria Bay in early December.

"Barataria Bay?" I practically shouted. "That's where the PIRATES are!"

Mr. Henderson nodded. "Yep."

"JEAN LAFITTE'S pirates?"

"The very same."

"But—but we're the NAVY! We FIGHT pirates!"

"Normally, yes." Mr. Henderson scratched his beard. "But apparently, General Jackson made a deal. The pirates are going to help us fight the British."

I stared at him. "Pirates. Are going to help. The United States of America."

"Strange times, Thibodaux. Strange times indeed."

**True Historical Fact**: Jean Lafitte was a French pirate (or "privateer," as he preferred) who operated out of Barataria Bay near New Orleans. The British actually approached Lafitte first, offering him money and land if he'd help them attack New Orleans. Instead, Lafitte warned the Americans about the British plans and offered to help defend the city!

At first, the Americans didn't trust him. Governor Claiborne had even put a bounty on Lafitte's head. But General Andrew Jackson, who was in charge of defending New Orleans, was desperate for fighters. He made a deal: if Lafitte and his men helped win the battle, they'd receive full pardons for all their crimes.

The pirates said yes.

I was mopping the deck (again) when the pirate ships arrived.

There were maybe a dozen of them, smaller than the Constitution but fast-looking and dangerous. They flew no flags—pirates, I'd learned, only raised the skull-and-crossbones when they wanted to scare someone.

And then I saw HIM.

Jean Lafitte.

He was standing at the bow of the lead ship, wearing a fancy coat and the biggest hat I'd ever seen. Even from a distance, he looked like a story come to life.

"That's really him," I breathed. "That's really Jean Lafitte."

"Don't go getting any ideas," Mr. Henderson warned. "He's a criminal. A smuggler. He's only helping because it benefits him."

"But he's also a HERO. He warned us about the British!"

"He's a hero for NOW. Doesn't mean he's a good person."

I watched as Lafitte's ship pulled alongside the Constitution. Officers from both vessels started shouting at each other, negotiating something.

And then Lafitte did something unexpected.

He looked directly at me.

At ME. A random ten-year-old mopping the deck.

And he WINKED.

Later that day, a group of us were sent ashore to help unload supplies.

Barataria Bay was amazing—and terrifying. There were pirates EVERYWHERE. Rough-looking men with scars and tattoos and more weapons than I could count. They spoke French (which I understood) and Spanish (which I didn't) and some language that might have been made up entirely.

I was carrying a barrel of salt pork when someone stepped in front of me.

"Tu es Cajun, non?"

I looked up. It was Lafitte. THE Jean Lafitte. Standing right in front of me.

"Y-yes sir," I stammered in French. "From New Orleans."

"New Orleans!" He smiled. "I love that city. Best food in America. What's your name?"

"Jasper Thibodaux, sir."

"And how does a boy from New Orleans end up on Old Ironsides?"

"I... accidentally joined the Navy?"

Lafitte burst out laughing. Not a mean laugh—a real, delighted laugh.

"Accidentally! Oh, that's wonderful. How does one ACCIDENTALLY join the Navy?"

"I was looking at the cannons and fell asleep in the cargo hold."

He laughed even harder. Some of his pirates nearby started laughing too, even though they probably didn't understand what was so funny.

"Jasper Thibodaux," Lafitte said, wiping his eyes, "you might be the most ridiculous sailor in the entire American fleet. I like you."

"Um... thank you?"

He clapped me on the shoulder. "Tell me something, Jasper. Can you shoot a gun?"

"No sir."

"Can you sail a ship?"

"Not really sir."

"Can you fight with a sword?"

"Definitely not sir."

"Then what CAN you do?"

I thought about it. "I can run really fast. And I know every street in New Orleans."

Lafitte's eyes lit up. "Every street?"

"My mama sells fish at the market. I've been everywhere."

"Interesting." He stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Very interesting."

He walked away without another word.

I had no idea what that was about.

But I had a feeling I'd find out.

Over the next few days, the American forces gathered.

It was the strangest army I'd ever seen—not that I'd seen many armies, but STILL.

There were regular American soldiers in blue uniforms. There were militia from Kentucky and Tennessee in buckskin and coonskin caps. There were Choctaw warriors who'd agreed to help fight the British. There were free Black soldiers from New Orleans. There were Creole gentlemen with fancy dueling pistols.

And there were pirates. Lots and lots of pirates.

General Andrew Jackson arrived on December 2nd, looking like he hadn't slept in a week.

**True Historical Fact**: Andrew Jackson was incredibly sick during the Battle of New Orleans. He had dysentery and could barely stand, but he refused to rest. Soldiers reported that he was so thin and pale he looked like a skeleton in a uniform. But sick or not, he was still terrifying. His nickname was "Old Hickory" because his soldiers said he was as tough as hickory wood.

"Listen up!" Jackson shouted to the gathered troops. (Well, he tried to shout. It came out as more of a loud croak.) "The British are coming. They've got more men than us, better training than us, and more experience than us."

Great pep talk, I thought.

"But they DON'T have something we have." Jackson paused dramatically. "They don't have New Orleans. This is OUR city. OUR home. And we are NOT going to let them take it!"

Cheers erupted. Soldiers fired their muskets in the air. The pirates howled like wolves.

I found myself cheering too, even though I was just a powder monkey who'd accidentally joined the Navy.

This was it. The battle for my home.

And somehow, I was going to be right in the middle of it.

That night, Jean Lafitte found me again.

"Jasper Thibodaux," he said. "How would you like to do something important?"

"Important? Me?"

"General Jackson needs messengers. Boys who know the city, who can run fast, who won't panic under fire." He raised an eyebrow. "You said you know every street in New Orleans."

"I do, but—"

"And you can run fast."

"Yes, but—"

"And you survived a naval battle without dying."

"That's true, but—"

"Then congratulations." Lafitte grinned. "You're now an official messenger for the United States Army. Report to General Jackson's headquarters at dawn."

He strolled away before I could argue.

I stood there, mouth hanging open.

I'd started this journey as a kid who accidentally fell asleep on a boat.

Now I was working for the most famous pirate in America AND the commanding general of the American forces.

My mother was going to have SO many questions.
