# Chapter 2: Old Ironsides (The Cannonballs Just Bounce Off!)

Being a powder monkey, I learned, was one of the most important—and most terrifying—jobs on a warship.

During battles, the cannons needed gunpowder to fire. But you couldn't just leave gunpowder lying around the deck—one spark and BOOM, the whole ship explodes. So the gunpowder was kept deep below in the magazine, where it was safe.

Powder monkeys were the kids who ran the gunpowder from the magazine to the cannons.

During a battle.

While people were shooting at us.

"The key," Mr. Henderson explained, "is to run VERY fast and not die."

"That's reassuring," I said.

"I'm not here to reassure you, Thibodaux. I'm here to keep you alive."

For the first week, I learned the ship.

The Constitution was like a floating city. There were over four hundred men on board—sailors, marines, officers, and now one extremely confused Cajun kid from New Orleans. Everyone had a job. Everyone had a place. Everyone knew exactly what to do.

Except me. I knew nothing.

"What's that rope for?"

"That's not a rope, that's a LINE. And it controls the mainsail."

"What's that thing?"

"That's the capstan. We use it to raise the anchor."

"What's THAT thing?"

"That's the captain. Stop pointing."

I learned to tie knots (badly). I learned to climb the rigging (terrifyingly). I learned to swab the deck (booooring). And I learned the layout of the ship, so I could run from the magazine to any cannon in under thirty seconds.

"Not bad," Mr. Henderson said after timing me. "You might actually survive a battle."

"MIGHT?"

"Well, you ARE pretty slow."

**True Historical Fact**: Powder monkeys were usually boys between 10-14 years old. Their small size helped them move quickly through the cramped spaces below deck. It was dangerous work—if a spark caught the gunpowder, the powder monkey could be killed instantly. But it was also an important job, and many naval officers started their careers as powder monkeys!

Three weeks into the voyage, the lookout spotted something on the horizon.

"SAIL HO! BRITISH WARSHIP, BEARING NORTHEAST!"

Everything changed in an instant.

Officers started shouting orders. Sailors ran to their stations. Marines climbed to the fighting tops—the platforms high on the masts where they'd shoot down at enemy ships.

Mr. Henderson grabbed my shoulder. "Thibodaux! Magazine! NOW!"

I ran.

Down the ladder, through the lower deck, past the hammocks, down another ladder, into the belly of the ship where the gunpowder waited in its protective room.

Other powder monkeys were already there—boys about my age, all looking terrified.

"Is this your first battle?" one asked me.

"Yes!"

"Mine too." He was shaking. "I heard British ships carry more guns than us."

"I heard our cannons bounce off our hull, though!"

"I heard that's just a story!"

Above us, the drums started beating. The call to battle.

*Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.*

My heart beat just as fast.

---

The battle happened in slow motion and fast motion at the same time.

One minute I was waiting in the magazine, grabbing cartridges of gunpowder. The next, I was running up ladders, cartridge clutched to my chest, sailors shouting all around me.

"FIRE!"

BOOM. The whole ship shook as our cannons went off.

"RELOAD! FASTER!"

I shoved the cartridge into a sailor's hands and ran back for more.

Up, down. Up, down. My legs burned. My lungs burned. But I kept running.

And then—

CRASH.

Something hit the side of the ship. Hard. I stumbled, expecting to see water pouring in, expecting the wall to splinter into a million pieces.

Instead... nothing.

"HA!" A sailor near me was laughing. "Did you hear that, boys? Bounced right off!"

I stared at the hull. There was a dent—just a DENT—where a cannonball had struck.

"Old Ironsides!" someone shouted. "They can't touch us!"

CRASH. Another cannonball hit. Bounced off.

CRASH. Another one. Same result.

The British were shooting at us, and their cannonballs were literally BOUNCING off our hull like ping pong balls!

I started laughing. I couldn't help it. It was the most ridiculous, wonderful, terrifying thing I'd ever seen.

---

The battle lasted two hours.

By the end, the British ship was a wreck. Her masts were broken. Her sails were shredded. Her captain was waving a white flag.

We had won.

The sailors cheered so loud I thought my ears would explode. Men were hugging each other, crying, laughing. Someone pulled out a fiddle and started playing.

I sat on a pile of rope, shaking.

Mr. Henderson found me there. "Still alive, Thibodaux?"

"I... I think so?"

"You did good. Real good. Fast enough when it counted."

"Mr. Henderson, the cannonballs really DO bounce off."

He grinned his three-toothed grin. "Told you, didn't I? Strongest ship in the whole United States Navy. The British have been trying to sink her since 1812. Hasn't worked yet."

He patted my shoulder and walked away to help with the prisoners.

I sat there for a long time, staring at the dented hull.

I had survived my first battle.

I was officially a sailor now.

And somewhere, very far away, my mother was going to be SO mad at me.

That night, the captain gathered everyone on deck.

"Men," he said, "today we proved once again that Old Ironsides cannot be beaten. The British thought they could outgun us. They were wrong."

Cheers erupted.

"But this war isn't over yet. We've received new orders." He paused. "We're sailing south. To the Gulf of Mexico. Word is, the British are planning something big—an attack on New Orleans."

My heart jumped. New Orleans! My home!

"We're going to make sure they don't succeed," the captain continued. "We'll rendezvous with other ships, and together, we'll defend the city."

More cheers.

I cheered too, but for a different reason.

New Orleans. We were going to New Orleans.

I might actually get to go home.

"Don't get too excited, Thibodaux," Mr. Henderson muttered next to me. "Getting there is only half the battle. Then we've got to actually FIGHT."

"Against how many British ships?"

"Not ships. Soldiers. Thousands of 'em, from what I hear."

"THOUSANDS?"

"Welcome to the war, powder monkey."

I swallowed hard.

Thousands of British soldiers.

Against... what? The Navy? The militia? The random fishermen and farmers of Louisiana?

This was going to be a disaster.

Little did I know, we were about to get help from the most unexpected source possible.

Pirates.
