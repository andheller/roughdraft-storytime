# Chapter 5: Home, With Stories Nobody Will Believe

The day after the battle, I went home.

My mother was standing in the doorway when I walked up, looking like she'd aged ten years in the months I'd been gone.

"JASPER THIBODAUX!"

"Hi, Mama."

"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA—"

"I know, I know—"

"WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!"

"I can explain—"

She ran down the steps and hugged me so hard I thought my ribs would crack.

"You're alive," she whispered into my hair. "You're alive, you're alive, you're alive."

"I'm alive, Mama. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

We stood there for a long time, just hugging.

When I finally told my family what happened, they didn't believe me.

"You fell asleep on a WARSHIP?"

"Yes, Papa."

"And sailed to BOSTON?"

"Somewhere up north, yes."

"And fought in a NAVAL BATTLE?"

"I was a powder monkey. I ran gunpowder to the cannons."

"And the cannonballs really BOUNCED OFF?"

"They really bounced off. The ship's hull is like two feet thick."

My grandmother—Mémère—just shook her head. "And what about the pirates? You mentioned pirates?"

"Jean Lafitte. He made me a messenger for General Jackson."

"JEAN LAFITTE?"

"He's actually pretty nice. He winked at me once."

Papa put his head in his hands. "My son. My ten-year-old son. Is friends with the most wanted pirate in Louisiana."

"WAS the most wanted. General Jackson gave him a pardon. He's legal now."

"That's not really the POINT, Jasper."

Mama was quiet through all of this. Finally, she asked, "And you really fought in the battle? The Battle of New Orleans?"

"I ran messages. Back and forth, for hours. I must have run twenty miles that day."

"And we won?"

"We won, Mama. The British are gone. They're not coming back."

She looked at me for a long moment. And then, somehow, she smiled.

"My son. The war hero."

"I'm not a hero. I just ran a lot."

"Heroes do all sorts of things, Jasper. Some of them fight. Some of them carry messages. Some of them just... don't give up, even when they're scared."

I thought about that.

I HAD been scared. Terrified, actually. The whole time—on the ship, in the battle, running through smoke and explosions.

But I'd kept going anyway.

Maybe that was what being brave meant.

**True Historical Fact**: After the Battle of New Orleans, Jean Lafitte did receive a pardon from President James Madison. He was officially forgiven for all his crimes in exchange for helping defend the city.

Of course, being Jean Lafitte, he didn't exactly retire. Within a few years, he was back to pirating, this time from Galveston Island in Texas. He eventually disappeared around 1823, and nobody knows for sure what happened to him. Some say he died in a sea battle. Others say he faked his death and lived to be an old man.

He's still a legend in New Orleans to this day.

Life went back to normal. Sort of.

I went back to helping Mama sell fish at the market. I went back to doing chores and avoiding schoolwork and dreaming about adventures.

But things were different now.

I'd SEEN things. DONE things. I'd survived a naval battle and worked with pirates and helped defend my city from the most powerful army in the world.

"Jasper seems different," I overheard Papa tell Mama one night.

"He grew up," Mama said simply. "He left as a boy and came back as... something else."

"A man?"

"Not quite. But getting there."

---

A few weeks later, I was at the market when I saw a familiar figure browsing the fish stalls.

Jean Lafitte.

He was dressed more simply now—no fancy coat, no giant hat. Just a regular (well, mostly regular) gentleman doing his shopping.

I ran over. "Mr. Lafitte!"

He turned and grinned. "Jasper Thibodaux! The fastest messenger in New Orleans!"

"You're still here! I thought you'd be... I don't know... pirating somewhere."

"I'm taking a break from pirating. For now." He winked. "Besides, someone has to eat all this excellent fish."

He bought three pounds of catfish from my mother's stall and paid twice what she was asking.

"For the war hero," he said when she tried to give back the extra money.

"He's not a hero," Mama said. "He's a troublemaker."

"Ah, but in my experience, those are often the same thing."

He tipped his hat and strolled away.

Mama stared at me. "Jean Lafitte. Jean LAFITTE. Just bought fish from us."

"I told you I knew him."

"I thought you were exaggerating!"

"I never exaggerate, Mama."

She gave me a look that said she did NOT believe that.

---

Years later, when I was old and gray and had grandchildren of my own, I still told the story of my accidental adventure.

"You really sailed on Old Ironsides?" they'd ask.

"I really did. And the cannonballs really bounced off."

"You really knew Jean Lafitte?"

"He bought fish from my mother."

"And you really fought at the Battle of New Orleans?"

"I ran messages. Faster than anyone."

They'd shake their heads in wonder. Sometimes they believed me. Sometimes they thought I was making it all up.

But I knew the truth.

I'd been there. I'd seen history happen. I'd been part of something bigger than myself—even if I'd gotten there completely by accident.

"Grandpa," my youngest granddaughter asked one day, "what's the most important thing you learned from your adventure?"

I thought about it for a long time.

"Don't fall asleep on boats?"

She laughed.

"But also," I said more seriously, "important things don't just happen to important people. They happen to everyone. Pirates and generals, sure. But also fishermen's sons who got curious about cannons. History is made by ALL of us. Even the ones who didn't mean to be there."

She nodded thoughtfully.

"Also," I added, "your mother will ALWAYS find out what you did. So you might as well tell the truth."

She laughed again.

Outside the window, I could hear the sounds of New Orleans—the city I'd helped save, all those years ago. The city of my childhood adventure.

The city where a ten-year-old accidentally joined the Navy, made friends with a pirate, and survived a battle that happened after the war was already over.

What a ridiculous story.

What a wonderful life.

## Did You Know?

**Real Historical Facts from This Story:**

1. **The USS Constitution really was called "Old Ironsides"** because cannonballs bounced off her thick hull during a battle in 1812. You can still visit the ship today in Boston Harbor—she's the oldest commissioned warship still afloat!

2. **Jean Lafitte really did help defend New Orleans!** The British offered him money to help them, but instead he warned the Americans and fought alongside them.

3. **The Battle of New Orleans was fought AFTER the war ended!** The Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24, 1814, but news traveled so slowly that nobody in Louisiana knew. The battle happened on January 8, 1815.

4. **Andrew Jackson really was very sick during the battle.** He could barely stand, but he refused to leave his men.

5. **The American army really was a mix of soldiers, militia, pirates, free Black soldiers, Choctaw warriors, and frontiersmen.** It was one of the most diverse fighting forces in American history up to that point.

6. **The British really did suffer devastating losses**—over 2,000 casualties compared to only about 70 American losses. It was one of the most lopsided victories in military history.

## Try This at Home!

1. **Build a model of a warship!** Research what ships like the Constitution looked like, and try making your own from cardboard or wood.

2. **Map Jean Lafitte's journey.** Look up Barataria Bay, Galveston, and the other places Lafitte sailed. What would it have been like to travel by ship in the 1800s?

3. **Write a letter home.** Pretend you're Jasper, stuck on the Constitution. What would you write to your mother?

4. **Research the War of 1812.** What else happened during this war? (Hint: The British burned the White House, and "The Star-Spangled Banner" was written!)
