# Chapter 4: The Battle After the War Was Over

January 8th, 1815.

The day of the Battle of New Orleans.

I woke up before dawn, my heart already pounding. This was it. The British were coming.

General Jackson had set up his defenses along the Rodriguez Canal, about four miles south of New Orleans. It wasn't much—just a muddy ditch with a wall of dirt, logs, and cotton bales behind it. But it was all we had.

"Cotton bales?" I'd asked when I first saw them. "We're hiding behind COTTON?"

"Cotton's thick," a Kentucky rifleman explained. "Might stop a musket ball if you're lucky."

I did not feel lucky.

**True Historical Fact**: The American defenses at the Battle of New Orleans were pretty makeshift. The main line was along a canal with an earthen rampart (fancy word for "dirt wall") reinforced with wooden planks, cotton bales, and whatever else the soldiers could find. The line stretched about a mile from the Mississippi River to a cypress swamp.

Behind this flimsy wall stood about 4,500 American troops. Facing them were over 8,000 British soldiers—many of whom had just defeated Napoleon in Europe. The British were some of the most experienced soldiers in the world.

Everyone expected the British to win.

I was stationed at General Jackson's headquarters, ready to carry messages wherever they needed to go. Around me, officers shouted orders. Soldiers checked their muskets. The pirates—Lafitte's men—manned the cannons, their faces grim.

"Thibodaux!" an officer yelled. "Message for Colonel Carroll on the left flank. GO!"

I ran.

Through the mud, past the cotton bales, dodging soldiers and supply wagons. I found Colonel Carroll, delivered the message, and ran back.

"Thibodaux! Message for Major Plauché! NOW!"

I ran again.

This was my job for the next three hours—running, running, running. My lungs burned. My legs screamed. But I kept going because somewhere out there, in the fog rolling off the river, thousands of British soldiers were marching toward us.

And then, just as the sun started to peek over the horizon, we heard it.

Drums.

British drums.

They were coming.

---

What happened next was the most incredible thing I've ever witnessed.

The British army emerged from the fog in perfect rows—red coats gleaming, bayonets fixed, drums beating. They looked unstoppable. They looked like the finest army in the world.

Because they WERE the finest army in the world.

They marched toward our little dirt wall, and I thought, "This is it. We're all going to die."

And then the American cannons opened fire.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

The pirates knew what they were doing. They'd spent years aiming cannons at ships, and now they aimed them at soldiers. Every shot tore holes in the British lines.

But the Redcoats kept coming.

They closed the distance. Four hundred yards. Three hundred. Two hundred.

"HOLD YOUR FIRE!" officers screamed along the American line. "WAIT FOR IT!"

The Kentucky and Tennessee riflemen crouched behind the wall, their long rifles steady. These men could hit a squirrel from a hundred yards. Now they were aiming at men.

One hundred yards.

Fifty yards.

"FIRE!"

The first volley was devastating. Hundreds of British soldiers fell. But the ones behind them climbed over the bodies and kept coming.

"RELOAD! FIRE!"

Another volley. More British soldiers fell.

"RELOAD! FIRE!"

It was like nothing I'd ever seen. The British kept charging, and the Americans kept shooting, and the smoke was so thick I could barely breathe.

And then—

The British broke.

They turned and ran.

The greatest army in the world, the soldiers who had defeated Napoleon himself, were RUNNING from a bunch of pirates and frontiersmen and farmers hiding behind cotton bales.

The cheering was so loud it hurt my ears.

**True Historical Fact**: The Battle of New Orleans was one of the most lopsided victories in American military history. In about 30 minutes of intense fighting:

- The British lost over 2,000 men (killed, wounded, or captured)
- The Americans lost only about 70 men

Why was it so one-sided? Several reasons:
1. The American artillery (manned largely by Lafitte's pirates) was devastating
2. The Kentucky and Tennessee riflemen were incredibly accurate
3. The British commander, General Pakenham, made some tactical mistakes
4. The British soldiers had to cross open ground while being shot at—never a good strategy

General Pakenham himself was killed during the battle, along with two other British generals.

I was still running messages when it ended.

One second there was chaos—gunfire, explosions, screaming. The next, there was just... quiet. Well, not quiet. Cheering. So much cheering.

"WE WON! WE WON!"

"Take THAT, Redcoats!"

"NEW ORLEANS STANDS!"

I collapsed against a cotton bale, gasping for breath.

We had done it. We had actually done it.

Jean Lafitte found me there an hour later. He had soot on his face and a grin that could light up the whole city.

"Jasper Thibodaux!" He pulled me to my feet. "You survived!"

"I survived!"

"How many messages did you carry?"

"I lost count after twenty!"

"Twenty messages during a battle!" He laughed and ruffled my hair. "You're the fastest powder monkey—sorry, MESSENGER—I've ever seen."

I couldn't stop smiling. We'd won. The British were retreating. New Orleans was safe.

And then someone told me the news that made everything even more ridiculous.

---

"The war's been over for two weeks," the officer said.

I stared at him. "What?"

"Treaty of Ghent. Signed on December 24th. The war ended on Christmas Eve."

"But... but we just FOUGHT a battle!"

"Yes. Because nobody TOLD us the war was over. Takes a long time for news to cross the Atlantic."

I sat down heavily.

The Battle of New Orleans—the most amazing, terrifying, incredible battle of the entire war—had been fought AFTER the war was already over.

We'd won a battle for nothing.

Well, no. Not for nothing. We'd defended our home. We'd proven that Americans could beat anyone, even the best army in the world. We'd shown the British that messing with New Orleans was a VERY bad idea.

But still.

THE WAR WAS ALREADY OVER.

"History," I muttered, "is absolutely ridiculous."

Lafitte, who was standing nearby, heard me and laughed.

"Welcome to history, Jasper. It rarely makes sense."
