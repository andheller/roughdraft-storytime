# Chapter 1: How to Accidentally Join the Navy

My name is Jasper Thibodaux, I'm ten years old, and I need to explain how I ended up on a warship heading into battle.

It was NOT my fault.

Okay, it was a LITTLE bit my fault. But mostly it was the fault of the USS Constitution, which should NOT have looked so interesting sitting there in the harbor like some kind of giant floating adventure just waiting to happen.

Let me back up.

---

The year was 1812. Actually, it was 1814 by the time my adventure really got going, but the war started in 1812, which is why everyone calls it "The War of 1812," even though most of the exciting stuff happened later. History is confusing like that.

I lived in New Orleans with my mama, my papa, and my grandmother, who we called Mémère. We were Cajun, which meant we spoke French at home, ate the best food in America (I will fight anyone who disagrees), and had about four hundred cousins scattered across Louisiana.

Papa was a fisherman. Mama sold fish at the market. Mémère told fortunes with cards and complained about her knees.

I was supposed to be a fisherman too. But I had other ideas.

See, I wanted to be a PIRATE.

Not a mean pirate who hurt people. A COOL pirate, like Jean Lafitte, who everyone in New Orleans whispered about. He had a whole island full of treasure! He stole from Spanish ships but left American ships alone! He was the most famous person in Louisiana!

(Papa said Jean Lafitte was a criminal and I should stop talking about him. I did not stop talking about him.)

Here's how I ended up on the Constitution.

In the summer of 1814, a bunch of American warships sailed into New Orleans for repairs and supplies. The whole city went crazy. Everyone wanted to see the ships. Everyone wanted to meet the sailors. Everyone wanted to touch a real cannon.

I snuck away from my fish-selling duties to get a closer look.

The Constitution was the biggest ship I'd ever seen. Three masts. Forty-four guns. Sailors everywhere, climbing ropes and carrying barrels and shouting at each other in words I didn't understand.

"She's a beauty, ain't she?" said a sailor walking past.

"She's AMAZING," I breathed. "Is it true cannonballs bounce off her?"

The sailor laughed. "That's why we call her Old Ironsides, boy. Her hull's made of live oak—strongest wood in America. British shot their cannons at us for hours once, and the balls just bounced right off. PING! PING! PING!"

My eyes went wide. "Can I go on board? Just for a minute?"

"Sorry, lad. Navy personnel only."

He walked away.

I looked at the gangplank leading up to the deck.

I looked around. Nobody was watching.

"Just a quick look," I told myself. "Just to see the cannons up close."

**True Historical Fact**: The USS Constitution got the nickname "Old Ironsides" after a battle with the British ship HMS Guerriere on August 19, 1812. During the fight, sailors reportedly saw British cannonballs bouncing off the Constitution's thick hull. One sailor supposedly shouted, "Huzza! Her sides are made of iron!" The name stuck.

The Constitution's hull was made of live oak from the southern states—some of the densest, strongest wood in the world. The hull was 21 inches thick in some places. That's almost two feet of solid wood between you and the cannonballs!

I crept up the gangplank, trying to look like I belonged.

Nobody stopped me.

The deck was INCREDIBLE. Cannons everywhere! Ropes as thick as my arm! A giant steering wheel! I touched everything I could reach, my heart pounding with excitement.

"Just a few more minutes," I whispered. "Then I'll go."

I found a ladder leading down below decks. Couldn't hurt to take a quick look, right?

Below, it was darker and smelled like salt and tar. Hammocks hung everywhere. More cannons lined the walls—wait, the sides of the ship. (I learned later they're called "gunwales." Navy people have weird names for everything.)

I walked deeper into the ship.

And deeper.

And somehow ended up in the cargo hold, where it was completely dark.

"Okay," I said to myself. "Time to go back."

I turned around.

I had no idea which way was "back."

"This is fine," I said. "I'll just... pick a direction."

I picked a direction.

It was the wrong direction.

---

I must have fallen asleep, because the next thing I knew, the ship was MOVING.

Not gentle moving. OCEAN moving. Up and down. Side to side. My stomach did a flip.

"No no no no NO—"

I scrambled up the first ladder I could find, burst onto the deck, and found myself staring at... open water.

New Orleans was gone.

The harbor was gone.

There was nothing but ocean in every direction.

"Oh no," I whispered.

A sailor spotted me immediately. "WHO THE DEVIL ARE YOU?"

I did what any sensible ten-year-old would do: I panicked.

"I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE CANNONS! I DIDN'T MEAN TO—I DON'T KNOW HOW—WHERE'S NEW ORLEANS?!"

More sailors gathered. A man in a fancy hat pushed through the crowd—the captain, I guessed.

"What's all this commotion?"

The first sailor pointed at me. "Stowaway, sir. Found him just now."

The captain looked me up and down. His face was stern, but his eyes were... tired? Amused? I couldn't tell.

"Name, boy?"

"J-Jasper Thibodaux, sir."

"Age?"

"Ten, sir."

"Ten." The captain sighed heavily. "And I suppose you have no sailing experience whatsoever?"

"I can fish! My papa's a fisherman!"

"Fishing is not sailing."

"They both involve water?"

A few sailors chuckled. The captain did not chuckle.

"We're not turning around," he said flatly. "We're on assignment, and we can't waste a week sailing back to New Orleans to return one foolish boy."

My heart sank. "So... what happens to me?"

The captain studied me for a long moment. Then he turned to a grizzled older sailor nearby.

"Mr. Henderson, we seem to have acquired a new powder monkey. See that he's trained."

"Aye, Captain."

The captain walked away.

I stared at Mr. Henderson. "What's a powder monkey?"

He grinned, showing three missing teeth.

"Welcome to the United States Navy, boy. You're gonna learn REAL fast."

That night, lying in a hammock that kept swinging every time the ship rocked, I tried to figure out how I was going to explain this to my mother.

*Dear Mama, I accidentally joined the Navy. Don't be mad.*

No, that wouldn't work.

*Dear Mama, I was looking at cannons and now I'm in the ocean.*

Even worse.

*Dear Mama, please don't kill me when I get home.*

That one was probably accurate, at least.

Somewhere above me, sailors were singing a sea shanty. The ship creaked and groaned. Outside, I could hear waves slapping against the hull.

I was on the most famous warship in America.

I was sailing toward who-knows-where.

And I was absolutely, definitely, one hundred percent in the biggest trouble of my entire life.

"At least," I muttered to myself, "things can't get any worse."

The ship lurched, and I fell out of my hammock.

Things, it turned out, could ALWAYS get worse.
