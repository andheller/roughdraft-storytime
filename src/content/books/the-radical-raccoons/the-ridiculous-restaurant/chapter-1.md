# The Grand Opening (Disaster)

Rascal stood in front of the abandoned building with his tiny raccoon paws on his hips. "This," he announced dramatically, "is going to be PERFECT!"

"It's full of old shoes and a broken washing machine," said Bandit, peering through the dusty window.

"Exactly!" Rascal's eyes gleamed. "We'll move those to make room for tables!"

Mittens adjusted the tiny bow tie she'd found in a dumpster last week. "Gentlemen," she said in her fanciest voice, "I believe what Rascal is trying to say is that we're opening a restaurant."

"A WHAT?" Bandit's mask-markings made his confused expression even more confused.

"A restaurant!" Rascal began pacing back and forth, which is quite something when you're only two feet tall. "Think about it! Humans are always going to restaurants. They PAY to eat food there. With MONEY!"

Trash Panda Pete, who had been quietly contemplating a interesting rock, looked up. "But we get food for free from garbage cans. Why would we pay for it?"

"Not us paying, Pete! Them paying! We make the food, they eat it, they give us money!" Rascal spread his little arms wide. "It's brilliant!"

"There's just one small problem," Mittens said, examining her reflection in the window. "None of us know how to cook."

There was a long pause.

"How hard could it be?" Rascal finally said.

---

Exactly three days later, the restaurant was "ready."

The old shoes had been stacked in the corner ("rustic décor," Mittens called it). The broken washing machine was now the "host stand" with a sign that said "WELCOM TO CHEZ RACCOON" in crayon.

"Why did you spell it like that?" Bandit asked.

"Like what?"

"W-E-L-C-O-M. There's no E at the end."

Rascal squinted at the sign. "Are you sure?"

"Pretty sure."

"Well, it's artistic now. French or something."

The kitchen was... well, it was a corner of the room with a camping stove they'd found behind a sporting goods store. Next to it sat their entire collection of ingredients: half a pizza they'd rescued from a dumpster yesterday, some slightly fuzzy bread, a can of beans with no label, and something that might have been cheese at some point in its life.

"Magnificent!" Rascal declared, putting on a chef's hat that was four sizes too big and kept sliding over his eyes. "Bandit, you're the waiter. Mittens, you greet the customers. Pete, you wash the dishes."

"What dishes?" Pete asked reasonably. They had two plates, both plastic.

"The dishes we're going to have AFTER we get customers!" Rascal adjusted his hat again. "Now, let's open these doors and—"

CRASH!

The front door fell completely off its hinges.

"—and that's fine! Easier for customers to get in!" Rascal's smile was perhaps a bit too enthusiastic. "Mittens, assume your position at the host stand!"

Mittens climbed onto the washing machine and posed elegantly, which is difficult when you're a raccoon standing on old laundry equipment.

For the first hour, nothing happened.

"Maybe we should have advertised," Bandit suggested, lying on his back and juggling acorns.

"Nonsense! Word of mouth is the best advertising!" Rascal said, though he was starting to sweat a little.

Then, a shadow appeared in the doorway.

"CUSTOMER!" Mittens shrieked in excitement, forgetting to use her fancy voice.

It was a opossum named Oscar, who looked extremely confused.

"Uh," Oscar said, "I was just looking for my ball that rolled this way..."

"NONSENSE!" Rascal bounded over, nearly losing his chef hat entirely. "You're clearly here for our GRAND OPENING! The finest dining establishment in... in... what street is this?"

"Maple Street?"

"THE FINEST DINING ESTABLISHMENT ON MAPLE STREET!" Rascal grabbed Oscar's paw and dragged him toward their single table (an upside-down bucket with a checkered napkin on it). "Bandit! The menu!"

Bandit froze. "The... the menu?"

"Yes! Give him the menu!"

"We don't have a menu."

Another long pause.

"SPECIALS!" Rascal shouted. "We only serve specials! It's more exclusive that way! Today's special is..." He ran to the kitchen, stared at their pathetic pile of ingredients, and ran back. "...is... is SURPRISE CASSEROLE!"

"What's in it?" Oscar asked nervously.

"If we told you, it wouldn't be a surprise!" Mittens said smoothly, having recovered her composure.

"I'm actually more of a bug person," Oscar said. "Do you have any beetles? Or maybe some nice grubs?"

All four raccoons stared at him.

"Beetles," Rascal repeated slowly.

"Yeah, you know, the crunchy ones?"

"We're a CLASSY establishment!" Mittens huffed. "We don't serve... bugs!"

"But we literally ate bugs for breakfast this morning," Pete pointed out.

"THAT WAS BREAKFAST! THIS IS DINNER SERVICE! COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!" Rascal was getting flustered. His chef hat fell over his eyes again. "The surprise casserole is... uh... very nutritious! And... hot! Probably!"

"Is it though?" Bandit whispered.

"MAKE IT HOT!" Rascal whispered back frantically.

In the kitchen, Rascal threw everything into a pot on the camping stove and stirred it with a stick. The pizza, the fuzzy bread, the mystery can (which turned out to be creamed corn), and the cheese-like substance all melded together into something that looked like it might be alive.

"It's... bubbling," Pete observed.

"That means it's working!" Rascal plopped the mixture onto their one plate and carried it out, walking very carefully so his hat didn't slip.

Oscar stared at the plate.

The plate stared back. Or at least, it felt like it did.

"That'll be fifteen dollars!" Mittens announced.

"Fifteen dollars?!" Oscar's eyes went wide. "I don't even have fifteen dollars! I'm an opossum!"

"First customer discount!" Rascal said quickly. "Uh... three dollars?"

"I have a button and some lint," Oscar offered.

"SOLD!"

Oscar took one bite of the surprise casserole. His eyes watered. His whiskers trembled. His tail went rigid.

Then he took another bite.

"This is..." he started.

Here it comes, Rascal thought. Our first review.

"...this is TERRIBLE!" Oscar shouted.

"Oh."

"It's awful! It's disgusting! It tastes like a shoe got married to a dumpster!"

The four raccoons looked at each other.

"So... you don't want seconds?" Bandit asked hopefully.

But Oscar was already running out the doorless doorway, button and lint still clutched in his paws.

Rascal's chef hat slipped down over his entire face.

"Well," came his muffled voice from under the hat, "that went great!"

"Great?" Mittens shrieked. "He hated it! He ran away!"

Rascal pushed his hat up. "Yes, but he ate it first! That means it's technically food! We're officially a restaurant now!"

Pete, ever the philosopher, nodded slowly. "He makes a compelling point."

"We're going to need more ingredients," Bandit said, eyeing their now-empty shelves.

"And maybe a door," added Mittens.

"And possibly a cookbook," Pete suggested.

Rascal grinned, showing all his tiny teeth. "This is going to be LEGENDARY!"

From down the street, they could still hear Oscar yelling about the casserole.

It was, perhaps, not the best start.

But it was definitely a start.
