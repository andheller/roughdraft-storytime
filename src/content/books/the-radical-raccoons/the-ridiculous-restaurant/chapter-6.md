# The Competition

"We got a refrigerator!" Pete announced proudly, pointing at the small mini-fridge they'd just installed. "It's only slightly dented and it keeps things cold!"

"That's wonderful!" Mittens said, organizing their new collection of actual cooking utensils. "We're becoming legitimate!"

It was Day Eight, and with Mortimer's investment money, they'd made serious progress. They now had:
- A door that stayed up (mostly)
- A real refrigerator (sort of)
- Actual plates (four of them!)
- A sink that worked (if you hit it first)
- A proper fire extinguisher (still unused, thankfully)
- Cleaning supplies (and they'd even used them!)

They'd fixed twenty-nine violations. Only fifteen to go before inspection in three days.

"We might actually pull this off," Rascal said, admiring their improved kitchen. It still looked like a disaster to anyone with actual restaurant experience, but to them, it was practically a palace.

That's when they heard it.

Classical music. Fancy, snooty classical music coming from outside.

They rushed to the doorway (the door was up right now, so they had to open it like civilized animals) and froze.

Across the street, where there used to be an empty building, there was now a restaurant. A fancy restaurant. With actual windows, a real door, a sign in gold lettering, and a swan in a tuxedo standing at the entrance.

The sign read: **"LE CYGNE SOPHISTIQUÉ"** (The Sophisticated Swan)

"That wasn't there yesterday," Bandit said slowly.

"It opened overnight," Pete observed. "That's... impressively fast."

The swan spotted them staring and glided across the street with aggressive elegance.

"Good morning," he said in an accent that was definitely fake but definitely expensive-sounding. "I am Sebastian, proprietor of Le Cygne Sophistiqué. We opened today to provide this neighborhood with TRUE fine dining. Unlike..." he looked at Chez Raccoon with barely concealed disgust, "...certain establishments."

"Hey!" Rascal stepped forward. "Our establishment is perfectly fine!"

"Your door is crooked."

"It's rustic!"

"Your menu is written on cardboard."

"It's recyclable!"

"And you are..." Sebastian looked down his long beak at them, "...raccoons."

"What's wrong with being raccoons?" Mittens demanded.

"Nothing, I suppose. If one is collecting garbage. But running a restaurant?" Sebastian laughed, a sound like wind chimes being pretentious. "That requires SOPHISTICATION. TRAINING. CLASS. Things I learned at the prestigious École de Cuisine in... in France."

"You're making that up," Pete said.

"I most certainly am NOT!" Sebastian ruffled his feathers indignantly. "Le Cygne Sophistiqué serves only the finest cuisine, prepared by trained professionals, in an atmosphere of elegance and refinement. We have tablecloths!"

"We have a table made of shoes," Bandit said proudly.

"Yes. I've noticed." Sebastian turned to leave, then paused. "You should close down, you know. Now that there's a REAL restaurant in the neighborhood, nobody will come to your... little project anymore."

"We have customers!" Rascal protested.

"Had customers, I think you mean. Good day, raccoons. Try not to give anyone food poisoning."

Sebastian glided back across the street and into his perfect, pristine restaurant.

The four raccoons stood in stunned silence.

"I don't like him," Mittens said finally.

"I don't like him either," Bandit agreed.

"I think his accent is fake," Pete added.

"WE'RE GOING TO BEAT HIM!" Rascal declared, his chef hat tilting dramatically. "We're going to show him that Chez Raccoon is BETTER than his fancy swan restaurant!"

"How?" Mittens asked reasonably. "He has tablecloths. We have a shoe table."

"We have CHARACTER!" Rascal paced back and forth. "We have PERSONALITY! We have... we have..."

"Violations?" Bandit suggested.

"Only fifteen now! That's practically none!"

"That's still fifteen."

"BESIDE THE POINT!" Rascal climbed onto their bucket table. "We're going to compete with Le Cygne Sophistiqué! We'll show everyone that fancy isn't always better!"

"But what if fancy IS better?" Pete asked philosophically.

"Then we'll be fancier! But weirder! Fancy-weird!"

"That's not a thing," Mittens said.

"IT IS NOW!"

They spent the morning trying to make Chez Raccoon more "fancy-weird." Mittens found a tablecloth in a dumpster (it had a spaghetti stain, but they put that side down). Bandit arranged the utensils in a fancy pattern he'd seen in a magazine once. Pete wrote a new menu on a nicer piece of cardboard. And Rascal attempted to cook something "sophisticated."

At noon, they opened for lunch service.

Nobody came.

At one o'clock, still nobody.

At two o'clock, they finally saw customers approaching. But instead of coming to Chez Raccoon, they walked right past and went into Le Cygne Sophistiqué.

"They didn't even LOOK at us!" Mittens cried.

"Maybe they didn't see us?" Bandit suggested.

"Our sign literally says 'AS SEEN ON FIONA'S FANCY FINDINGS!' How could they miss it?"

Rascal pressed his face against their window (which was slightly dirty, but that was beside the point). He could see inside Le Cygne Sophistiqué. It was beautiful. Crystal glasses. White tablecloths. Servers in perfect uniforms. And food that looked like it had been arranged by artists.

"We can't compete with that," he said quietly.

"Maybe we're not supposed to," Pete said thoughtfully.

Everyone turned to look at him.

"What do you mean?" Rascal asked.

"We're not a fancy restaurant. We never were. We're a weird restaurant run by raccoons who serve garbage with confidence. That's our thing. Sebastian wants to be fancy? Let him. We'll be us."

"But all our customers are going to HIS restaurant!"

"Are they though?" Pete pointed to their doorway. "Look."

Oscar the opossum was standing there, looking nervous.

"Um, hi," Oscar said. "Is this a bad time?"

"OSCAR!" All four raccoons shouted in relief.

"You came back!" Rascal rushed over. "Even after the terrible casserole!"

"ESPECIALLY after the terrible casserole!" Oscar said, coming inside. "I brought friends!"

Behind him were six more opossums, all looking excited.

"We wanted to try this place everyone's talking about," one of them said. "My name's Oliver. This is Olivia, Owen, Odette, Omar, and Opal."

"Why do all opossums have O names?" Bandit whispered to Pete.

"It's their thing. Don't question it."

The opossums sat at their tables (bucket table, cardboard box table, and shoe table) and looked at the menu.

"I'll have the Special!" Oscar said immediately.

"You remember what happened last time," Rascal reminded him.

"I know! It was MEMORABLE! That's why I came back!"

More customers started trickling in. The three rabbits from before (Barbara, Bob, and Steve—Steve still looked nervous). A family of chipmunks. Two mice who were holding hands and appeared to be on a date.

"We almost went to that fancy place across the street," said one of the mice, "but then we thought, 'You know what? We can go to fancy restaurants anytime. When else are we going to eat at a restaurant run by raccoons?'"

"EXACTLY!" Rascal's confidence was returning. "We're not fancy! We're UNIQUE!"

The lunch service was chaotic in the way they'd become used to. Rascal cooked with creative abandon. Bandit served with enthusiastic clumsiness. Mittens hosted with dramatic flair. And Pete provided philosophical observations that nobody asked for but somehow appreciated.

Across the street, Sebastian watched through his perfect windows as Chez Raccoon filled with happy customers while his restaurant sat empty except for one confused turtle who thought it was a museum.

By three o'clock, every table at Chez Raccoon was full. They'd even had to add a fifth table made of books stacked up with a tray on top.

"Book table!" Mittens announced proudly.

"Is it stable?" asked Oliver the opossum.

"Absolutely not! But that's part of the charm!"

Sebastian couldn't take it anymore. He stormed across the street and burst through Chez Raccoon's door (which stayed up, thank you very much).

"HOW?" he demanded. "How are you succeeding? Your restaurant is a disaster! You have a TABLE MADE OF SHOES!"

"That's our best table!" Oscar called out from the shoe table.

"Your food is garbage! LITERAL GARBAGE!"

"It's LOCALLY SOURCED!" Rascal corrected.

"You have health code violations!"

"Only fifteen now!" Bandit said proudly.

"ONLY FIFTEEN?" Sebastian was practically molting with rage. "I have ZERO violations! ZERO! My restaurant is perfect! My food is perfect! My tablecloths are PERFECTLY PRESSED!"

"Then why is nobody in your restaurant?" Pete asked simply.

Sebastian froze. He looked around at all the happy customers eating terrible food at ridiculous tables in a restaurant that shouldn't work but somehow did.

"I... I don't understand," he said, his fake accent slipping a bit.

"That's your problem," Mittens said, adjusting her fake glasses. "You're trying to be perfect. We're just trying to be ourselves."

"But I went to cooking school!" Sebastian protested. "I trained for years! I learned classical French cuisine!"

"Did you though?" Pete asked. "Or did you just watch cooking shows?"

Sebastian's feathers drooped. "...I watched a LOT of cooking shows."

"Look," Rascal said, taking off his chef hat for a moment, "there's nothing wrong with fancy restaurants. The world needs fancy restaurants. But the world also needs weird restaurants run by raccoons who don't know what they're doing but are trying really hard. We're not competing with you. We're just... different."

"But I spent all my savings opening Le Cygne Sophistiqué," Sebastian said quietly. "I thought being fancy was what everyone wanted."

The customers looked at each other.

"We like fancy sometimes," Barbara the rabbit said diplomatically. "But sometimes we want weird."

"Yeah," Oscar agreed. "Sometimes you want a meal you'll tell stories about."

"Your restaurant looks beautiful," said one of the mice on the date. "Maybe we'll go there for our anniversary. But today? Today we wanted an adventure."

Sebastian looked around at all the encouraging faces. Then at the shoe table. Then at the cardboard menu. Then at the four raccoons who were trying so hard.

"Would you..." he started, then stopped, then started again. "Would you teach me how to be weird?"

"WHAT?" all four raccoons said.

"I know how to cook fancy food. But I don't know how to have fun. I don't know how to make people laugh. I don't know how to..." he gestured at the chaos around them, "...how to make THIS work."

Rascal looked at his friends. They had a silent conversation with their eyes (which is impressive for animals, but they'd gotten good at it).

"Okay," Rascal said finally. "But you have to promise not to steal our customers."

"I promise."

"And you have to admit your accent is fake."

Sebastian sighed. "My accent is fake. I'm from New Jersey."

"NEW JERSEY?" everyone shouted.

"I thought it sounded sophisticated!"

"It sounded ridiculous," Pete said.

"Well, yes. But isn't that what you're going for?"

Rascal grinned. "You know what? You're going to fit right in. Welcome to Chez Raccoon, Sebastian. Let me show you how to cook with confidence and absolutely no skill whatsoever."

"This is a terrible idea," Mittens whispered to Pete.

"All our ideas are terrible ideas," Pete whispered back. "That's why they work."

Sebastian took off his tuxedo jacket, rolled up his wing sleeves (do swans have sleeves? They do now), and joined the chaos.

He was terrible at it. He was used to precision and technique. But slowly, with the raccoons' help, he learned to let go. To make mistakes. To serve food that looked weird and tasted weirder and somehow made people happy anyway.

By the end of the day, Sebastian had cooked his first "Le Spécial du Jour"—a creation that combined his fancy cooking knowledge with the raccoons' complete disregard for rules. It was sophisticated and ridiculous at the same time.

"Fancy-weird," Rascal said approvingly.

"I hate that I like this," Sebastian admitted.

That evening, after all the customers left, Sebastian made an announcement.

"I'm going to change Le Cygne Sophistiqué," he said. "I'll still serve fancy food, but I'll make it fun. And maybe..." he looked at the raccoons hopefully, "maybe sometimes we can collaborate? Fancy nights at my place, weird nights at yours?"

"A partnership?" Mittens's eyes lit up.

"Why not? We're neighbors. And apparently, I have a lot to learn from four raccoons who cook with a stick."

"We have spoons now," Bandit pointed out.

"Even better."

They shook hands (and wings) on it. The competition was over before it really began, transformed into something better: a collaboration.

As Sebastian walked back to his restaurant, Rascal looked at his friends.

"Three days until inspection," he said.

"Fifteen violations to go," Pete added.

"But now we have an ally," Mittens said.

"And customers who love us," Bandit finished.

"We're going to make it," Rascal declared. "I can feel it."

Across the street, Sebastian turned his perfect restaurant's lights off and smiled. He'd come to Maple Street to compete, but he'd found something better.

He'd found friends.

And maybe that was fancier than any tablecloth.
