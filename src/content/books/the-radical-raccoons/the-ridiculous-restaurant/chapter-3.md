# The Inspector Arrives

It was Day Five of Chez Raccoon being open, and things were going surprisingly well. They now had TWO plates (the second one was a frisbee, but customers didn't need to know that). Business was booming—by which they'd had seven customers total, and only two of them had asked for refunds.

Rascal was in the kitchen, attempting to make something he called "Le Scrambled Egg Experience" (it was actually scrambled eggs, but saying "experience" made it sound fancier). Mittens was reorganizing their decoration shoes for the third time. Bandit was supposed to be sweeping but was actually taking a nap. And Pete was outside, contemplating a particularly interesting cloud.

That's when they heard the sound.

*TAP TAP TAP.*

It was the sound of someone knocking, which was unusual because they still didn't have a door.

"Hello?" called a crisp, official-sounding voice. "Is this establishment currently operating as a food service business?"

A crane—and not just any crane, but an extremely tall, extremely official-looking crane wearing a clipboard and a badge—stepped carefully over the door-on-the-ground.

"I am Inspector Patricia Wingspan from the Department of Health and Safety," she announced, adjusting her very serious glasses. "I'm here for your surprise inspection."

All the blood drained from Rascal's face. Which is hard to see on a raccoon, but trust me, it happened.

"Inspection?" he squeaked.

"Yes. It's come to our attention that you're operating a restaurant. All restaurants require health inspections." Inspector Wingspan clicked her pen with a sound that felt like doom. "This won't take long. Assuming, of course, everything is up to code."

Mittens, thinking quickly, climbed onto her washing machine. "Of course everything is up to code! We are a VERY professional establishment! Would you like me to show you to a table while you wait?"

"I'm not here to eat," Inspector Wingspan said, peering around with eyes that missed nothing. "I'm here to inspect. Let's start with... is that door supposed to be on the floor?"

"Modern architecture!" all four raccoons said at once.

Inspector Wingspan wrote something on her clipboard. It looked like it might be bad.

"And your kitchen? May I see it?"

Rascal jumped in front of the kitchen corner. "The kitchen! Yes! The kitchen is... it's being... deep cleaned! Right now! Very thoroughly! Can't disturb the deep cleaning!"

"Step aside, please."

Rascal stepped aside.

Inspector Wingspan looked at their camping stove, their pile of suspicious ingredients, the stick they used to stir things, and the collection of containers that definitely used to hold other things before becoming "storage."

She wrote more things on her clipboard. Many things. None of them looked good.

"I see," she said in a tone that meant she saw TOO much. "And your food storage? Temperature controls? Refrigeration?"

"We have a cooler!" Bandit said, waking up from his nap. "It's... uh..." He looked around. "We HAD a cooler."

"We ate what was in it and then a squirrel took it," Pete admitted.

More clipboard writing. So much clipboard writing.

"Hand washing station?" Inspector Wingspan asked.

"The hose out back!" Rascal said hopefully.

"Temperature monitoring for cooked foods?"

"We poke it with our finger to see if it's hot?"

"Proper ventilation?"

"We open the door! Oh wait, the door is already open. Because it's on the ground."

"Pest control?"

All four raccoons looked at each other.

"We... are the pests?" Bandit offered.

Inspector Wingspan stopped writing and looked at them over her glasses. "Are you telling me that this 'restaurant' consists of four raccoons, a camping stove, a pile of questionable food, no proper storage, no safety equipment, no actual door, and furniture made of garbage?"

"The washing machine isn't garbage!" Mittens protested. "It's vintage!"

"It doesn't work."

"That's what makes it vintage!"

Inspector Wingspan sighed the longest sigh ever sighed. "I'm going to have to shut you down."

"WHAT?" Rascal's chef hat fell over his face in shock. "You can't! We just started! We have customers! Real customers with money!"

"I'm sorry, but you're violating approximately..." she counted on her clipboard, "...forty-seven different health codes. Forty-eight if we count whatever that is in the corner."

They all looked. None of them knew what it was either.

"But we're getting better!" Rascal pleaded. "We have TWO plates now! That's twice as many as before!"

"One of them is a frisbee."

"A CLEAN frisbee!"

Inspector Wingspan shook her head. "I understand you're trying, but running a restaurant is serious business. People's health depends on proper food safety. You could make someone very sick."

"We haven't yet!" Bandit said cheerfully.

"YET being the important word," the inspector countered.

Mittens stepped forward, removing her fake glasses in what she hoped was a dramatic gesture. "Inspector Wingspan, may I speak candidly?"

"Please do."

"We're just four raccoons trying to make an honest living. Yes, we started this restaurant without knowing what we were doing. Yes, our kitchen is... questionable. Yes, we served someone a bagel with a pickle and a french fry and called it fusion cuisine. But we're LEARNING! Isn't that what matters?"

Inspector Wingspan's expression softened slightly. "Learning is admirable. But you can't learn while putting customers at risk."

"What if..." Pete spoke up quietly, "what if you helped us?"

Everyone turned to look at him.

"What if instead of shutting us down, you told us what we need to do to be... properly bad at running a restaurant instead of dangerously bad?"

Inspector Wingspan blinked. "That's... actually not a terrible idea."

"Really?" Rascal's eyes went wide.

"I'll make you a deal," she said, tapping her clipboard. "I'm going to give you a list of things you MUST fix. We're talking real doors, proper food storage, cleaning supplies, actual plates—not frisbees. You have one week to make these changes. Then I come back for a re-inspection. If you pass, you can stay open. If you fail..." She drew a line across her throat.

"That's very aggressive body language," Bandit whispered.

"One week," Rascal said, standing up straight. "We can do that."

"Can we?" Mittens whispered.

"We have to," he whispered back.

Inspector Wingspan tore off several pages from her clipboard and handed them to Rascal. "This is your violation list. It's... extensive."

Rascal looked at the pages. There were five full pages of violations. In small handwriting.

"Some of these I didn't even know were possible," Pete said, reading over his shoulder. "'Improper use of stick as cooking utensil.' That's a rule?"

"It is now," Inspector Wingspan said. She walked toward the door, then remembered the door was on the ground, and just walked out the doorway. "I'll see you in one week. Good luck. You're going to need it."

After she left, the four raccoons sat in silence, staring at the violation list.

"Forty-seven violations," Mittens said quietly.

"Forty-eight if we count the corner thing," Bandit added.

"We're doomed," Rascal moaned, his chef hat falling off completely this time.

"Not necessarily," Pete said, still reading the list. "Look, a lot of these are fixable. 'Get a proper door'—we can find a door. 'Use actual cooking utensils'—dumpsters have spoons sometimes. 'Store food at proper temperatures'—okay, that one's harder."

"How are we going to afford all this?" Mittens asked. "We've made thirty-seven dollars total. That's not enough for... what does this say... 'a commercial-grade refrigeration unit'?"

"We'll figure it out," Rascal said, picking up his hat and putting it back on with determination. "We've come too far to give up now!"

"We've been open five days," Bandit pointed out.

"EXACTLY! FIVE DAYS OF PROGRESS!"

"Five days of violations, you mean."

"PROGRESS VIOLATIONS!"

Pete stood up, brushing off his paws. "Rascal's right. We can do this. We just need a plan."

"A plan?" Mittens perked up. "I love plans!"

"First, we need money for supplies. Which means we need more customers. Which means..." Pete looked at their terrible kitchen, their washing machine host stand, their bucket table, and their door on the ground. "We need to make this place SO interesting that people come despite all this."

"You want us to lean INTO the chaos?" Bandit asked.

"I'm saying we make it an experience. We're not just a restaurant—we're the ONLY restaurant run entirely by raccoons. That's unique. That's special."

Rascal's eyes started gleaming again with terrible ideas. "We make it a THEME!"

"I'm not sure that's what Pete meant—" Mittens started.

"We're not just Chez Raccoon anymore," Rascal announced, climbing onto the bucket. "We're CHEZ RACCOON: THE WILDEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN TOWN!"

"That's too many words for a sign," Bandit said.

"Then we'll get a BIGGER SIGN!"

"With what money?"

"With the money we're going to make from all our new customers!"

"What new customers?"

"THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO COME BECAUSE WE'RE FAMOUS!"

Inspector Wingspan, walking back to her car, heard shouting from inside the restaurant and decided she didn't want to know.

One week, she thought. There's no way they'll pass the re-inspection.

But there was something about those four ridiculous raccoons that made her hope, just a little bit, that maybe they would.

Or at least that they wouldn't burn the building down trying.

That was probably the best she could hope for.
