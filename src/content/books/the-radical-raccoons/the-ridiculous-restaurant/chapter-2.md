# The Menu Madness

"We need a proper menu," Mittens declared the next morning. She'd found a pair of tiny reading glasses with no lenses and wore them to look more professional.

"Agreed," said Rascal, who was wearing his chef hat even though he was eating breakfast (which was bugs, not that he'd admit it during dinner service). "A menu with CLASS. With STYLE. With items that sound SO GOOD that customers will forget about Oscar running away screaming!"

"He didn't scream," Pete said thoughtfully. "More of a loud yelling situation."

"ANYWAY," Rascal continued, pulling out a piece of cardboard. "Bandit, you have the best handwriting. You write while I dictate the menu."

Bandit picked up a crayon. "Ready."

"First item: Garbage Surprise Deluxe."

Everyone stared at Rascal.

"What?" he said defensively. "It's honest!"

"We can't call it GARBAGE," Mittens said, adjusting her fake glasses. "Customers want to feel fancy! We need to use... what's the word... FANCY words!"

"Foreign words," Pete added. "Humans love when they can't pronounce things."

"Perfect!" Rascal's eyes lit up. "Okay, okay... instead of Garbage Surprise Deluxe, we'll call it... uh..."

"Le Garbage Surprise Deluxe?" Bandit offered.

"Put 'Le' in front of everything!" Mittens clapped her paws together. "That's French! French is fancy!"

"Is it though?" Pete asked.

"Don't ruin this for us, Pete."

Bandit wrote at the top of the cardboard: **LE MENU**

"Ooh, that's good," Rascal said. "Okay, first item: Le Garbage Surprise Deluxe. Description: A delightful medley of... uh... found ingredients?"

"'Locally sourced ingredients,'" Mittens corrected. "Technically, the dumpster behind the grocery store IS local."

"Brilliant!" Bandit wrote it down. "Next?"

Rascal paced back and forth, thinking. "We need variety. What if someone doesn't want garbage—I mean, locally sourced ingredients?"

"We could offer them garbage from a DIFFERENT dumpster," Pete suggested helpfully.

"NO! I mean, yes, but we need to make it sound different!" Rascal snapped his fingers. "Item two: Dumpster Diving Delight! I mean... uh..."

"Le Container Treasures?" Mittens tried.

"Le Mysterious Bin Medley?"

"Le Whatever We Found This Morning?"

"How about just... Le Spécial du Jour?" Pete said quietly.

Everyone turned to look at him.

"That just means 'special of the day,'" Pete explained. "But humans won't know that."

"PETE, YOU'RE A GENIUS!" Rascal jumped up and down. "Yes! We can serve literally ANYTHING and just call it Le Spécial du Jour! It changes every day! Every HOUR! Every CUSTOMER if we want!"

"That's... actually kind of sneaky," Bandit said admiringly.

"That's BUSINESS," Mittens corrected, though she looked pleased.

By lunchtime, they had created the most ridiculous menu in history:

**CHEZ RACCOON - LE MENU**

*Appetizers:*
- Le Toast Points (old bread, broken into triangles)
- Le Cheese Explosion (any cheese that's gone weird)
- Le Mystery Balls (we found them, we don't know what they are, but they're round)

*Main Courses:*
- Le Spécial du Jour (whatever we found today)
- Le Pasta Extraordinaire (there's spaghetti in that dumpster sometimes)
- Le Pizza Redux (yesterday's pizza, but with more stuff on it)
- Le Surprise Casserole (you remember this one, Oscar sure does)

*Desserts:*
- Le Sweet Thing (might be cake? might be soap? it's a surprise!)
- Le Fruit Maybe (if it's round and squishy, it's probably fruit)
- Le Yesterday's Donut (self-explanatory)

*Beverages:*
- Le Water (from the hose out back)
- Le Fancy Water (same water, but in a fancier cup)
- Le Extremely Fancy Water (we tell you it's imported)

"This is either brilliant or illegal," Bandit said, stepping back to admire their work.

"Can it be both?" Pete asked.

Before anyone could answer, they heard voices outside.

"Oh no," Mittens whispered. "CUSTOMERS!"

"OH NO!" Rascal whispered back. "I MEAN OH YES! CUSTOMERS!"

Three rabbits hopped through the still-doorless doorway. They were wearing little business suits and carrying tiny briefcases.

"Welcome to Chez Raccoon!" Mittens scrambled onto her washing machine. "Table for three?"

"We heard about this place from Oscar," said the first rabbit, whose name tag read "Barbara."

Rascal froze. "You... you did?"

"Yes! He said it was the most INTERESTING meal he'd ever had!" said the second rabbit, "Bob."

"I'm sensing a theme with your names," Pete muttered.

The third rabbit, whose name was actually "Steve," just looked around nervously. "Is the door supposed to be on the ground?"

"It's modern architecture!" Mittens said quickly. "Very trendy! Your table awaits!"

She gestured dramatically to their bucket-table. The three rabbits squeezed around it, which was challenging because rabbits have very large feet.

Bandit rushed over with the cardboard menu, nearly tripping over his own tail.

"Today's specials look very... special," Barbara said, squinting at the cardboard. "What exactly is in Le Mystery Balls?"

"If we told you," Rascal said, appearing in his chef hat, "they wouldn't be mysterious!"

"But what if I'm allergic?"

Rascal hadn't thought of that. "Uh... are you allergic to... things?"

"Things?"

"Various... food-shaped items?"

"That's not reassuring," Steve said.

"I'll have Le Pasta Extraordinaire," Bob decided. "Pasta is hard to mess up."

Rascal and Bandit exchanged a look. In the kitchen, they had exactly zero pasta.

"EXCELLENT CHOICE!" Rascal shouted, too loudly. "And for you, madame?"

Barbara studied the menu carefully. "Le Spécial du Jour. What's in it today?"

Rascal glanced at their kitchen. They had: one old bagel, something that might be a pickle, and what appeared to be a french fry from three days ago.

"It's a... a fusion cuisine!" he announced. "A delicate combination of... bread-based foundation, fermented vegetable, and a golden potato stick!"

"That sounds sophisticated," Barbara nodded approvingly.

"I'll just have Le Water," Steve said nervously.

"BORING!" Mittens shouted from her host stand, then caught herself. "I mean, a classic choice, sir."

In the kitchen, Rascal and Bandit stared at their pathetic pile of ingredients.

"We don't have pasta," Bandit said.

"I KNOW we don't have pasta!"

"The menu says we have pasta."

"I KNOW what the menu says!"

"So what do we do?"

Rascal spotted something in the corner. "Is that... is that string?"

"I think it's yarn from when the old lady who lived here knitted stuff?"

Rascal's eyes gleamed with terrible ideas. "Bandit, if we boil this yarn, do you think..."

"No."

"But consider—"

"Absolutely not."

"What if we—"

"Rascal, we can't serve them YARN!"

Pete poked his head into the kitchen. "Did someone say yarn? Because there's actually spaghetti in the dumpster behind Tony's Pizza right now. I checked this morning."

Both Rascal and Bandit stared at him.

"You KNEW there was spaghetti and didn't MENTION IT?" Rascal shrieked.

"You didn't ask," Pete said reasonably. "I'll go get it."

Ten minutes later, Pete returned with a container of slightly used spaghetti. Rascal heated it up, threw some of the mystery cheese on it, and arranged it on their one plate as artistically as possible (which wasn't very artistic, but he tried).

For Barbara's Spécial du Jour, he assembled the bagel, pickle, and french fry into something that looked like a very confused sandwich.

"SERVICE!" he called out, which was something he'd heard on a cooking show once.

Bandit delivered the plates with as much dignity as a raccoon wearing a bow tie can muster.

The rabbits stared at their food.

The food seemed to stare back.

"Bon appétit!" Mittens called from the host stand.

Barbara took a bite of her sandwich-thing. Her nose twitched. Then twitched again. Then she took another bite.

"This is... weird," she said finally.

"Weird bad or weird good?" Rascal asked nervously.

"Weird... interesting?" Barbara seemed confused by her own reaction. "I've never had anything like it."

Bob tried his spaghetti. "This tastes like it was in a dumpster!"

Panic.

"Because... because we use AUTHENTIC Italian preparation methods!" Rascal said quickly. "Very traditional! They age everything in... in special containers!"

"Oh!" Bob took another bite. "How cultural!"

Steve sipped his water and said nothing, which was probably the smartest move.

When the meal was over, Barbara stood up. "Well, that was certainly an experience. How much do we owe you?"

Rascal hadn't actually figured out a pricing system beyond "whatever people will pay."

"Uh... twenty dollars?"

"For three meals?" Barbara raised an eyebrow.

"Too much?" Rascal squeaked.

"Actually, that's pretty reasonable for a sit-down restaurant." Barbara pulled out a twenty-dollar bill.

Real money. Actual human money.

Rascal's paws trembled as he took it.

"We'll probably come back," Bob said. "This place is bizarre, but it's interesting."

"The door situation is still concerning," Steve added quietly.

After the rabbits left, all four raccoons stared at the twenty-dollar bill.

"We're rich," Bandit whispered.

"We're restaurateurs!" Mittens said in her fanciest voice.

"We're probably going to poison someone eventually," Pete observed.

"LET'S NOT FOCUS ON THAT RIGHT NOW!" Rascal shouted, dancing around with the twenty-dollar bill. "We did it! We served customers! They paid us! Nobody ran away screaming!"

"I heard Steve screaming a little," Pete said.

"INTERNALLY DOESN'T COUNT!"

Mittens updated their cardboard menu, adding stars next to the most popular items (which was all of them, since they'd only had one table).

"Tomorrow," Rascal announced, standing on their bucket-table, "we're going to be even BIGGER! Even BETTER! We'll have so many customers, we'll need more plates!"

"We only have one plate," Bandit pointed out.

"Then we'll need... TWO PLATES!"

It was a modest dream.

But it was their dream.

And somewhere in the distance, Oscar was still telling everyone about the weird restaurant run by raccoons.

Which, as it turned out, was the best advertising they could have asked for.
