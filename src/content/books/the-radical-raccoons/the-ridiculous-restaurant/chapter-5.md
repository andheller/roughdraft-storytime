# The Kitchen Catastrophe

"I FOUND A STOVE!" Bandit shouted, dragging a small electric hot plate through the doorway. "It was sitting next to a trash can with a sign that said 'FREE - WORKS SOMETIMES'!"

"'Works sometimes' is better than 'never works'!" Rascal said enthusiastically. "That's our new motto!"

"That's a terrible motto," Mittens said, but she was too busy arranging their three new plates (two real plates and one very plate-like piece of wood) to argue much.

It was Day Seven, the day after Fiona's review, and Chez Raccoon had used their hundred dollars to buy:
- One actual door (slightly warped, but it stayed up!)
- Three plates (ish)
- A collection of utensils from a garage sale
- A small cooler filled with ice
- Cleaning supplies (which none of them really knew how to use)
- A fire extinguisher (bright red and very official-looking)

They'd also spent twelve dollars on a sign that said "CHEZ RACCOON - AS SEEN ON FIONA'S FANCY FINDINGS!" which was arguably the best investment they'd made.

"We still have thirty-nine violations," Pete said, reading through the list.

"But we have a DOOR!" Rascal pointed at it proudly.

As if on cue, the door fell off its hinges again.

"A SOMETIMES DOOR!"

"We need to fix that before inspection in five days," Mittens said.

"We need to fix a LOT of things," Bandit added. "But first, we need to survive today. Look."

He pointed outside. There was a line. An actual line of customers waiting to get into their restaurant.

"Oh no," Pete whispered.

"OH YES!" Rascal corrected. "This is what we wanted! Customers! Lots of them!"

"But we're not ready!" Mittens squeaked.

"We're never ready! That's our secret!" Rascal put on his chef hat. "Bandit, you're on service. Mittens, host stand. Pete, you're going to help me cook!"

"I don't know how to cook," Pete said.

"Neither do I! That's never stopped us before!"

They propped the door back up (it would fall again in approximately fifteen minutes, but they didn't know that yet) and opened for business.

The first customers were a family of squirrels who were extremely excited.

"We heard this place serves weird food!" said the mother squirrel.

"The WEIRDEST!" Rascal confirmed.

"And the door falls down randomly?"

"REGULARLY!"

"Perfect!" The squirrels sat at the bucket table. The second table was a cardboard box that said "FRAGILE - THIS SIDE UP" but was being used upside down.

More customers poured in: three chipmunks, two more opossums (friends of Oscar), a confused turtle who thought this was a library, and a very sophisticated mouse wearing a monocle.

"ORDERS!" Mittens shouted, because they didn't have a proper ordering system. "The squirrel family wants four Spécials! The chipmunks want Le Mystery Balls! The mouse wants... what did you order, sir?"

"I'll have whatever won't kill me," said the mouse nervously.

"We can't guarantee that!" Rascal called from the kitchen.

"I'LL HAVE THE WATER!"

In the kitchen, chaos was erupting.

"We don't have enough food for all these orders!" Pete said, looking at their supplies. They had: eggs, some bread, a questionable tomato, half a cheese wheel they'd found (found WHERE, nobody asked), and a can labeled "BEANS" in three languages, none of which were English.

"Then we GET CREATIVE!" Rascal declared. He cracked eggs into a pan on the camping stove while simultaneously trying to heat soup on the new hot plate. "This is fine! Everything is fine!"

The hot plate started smoking.

"Is that supposed to happen?" Pete asked.

"Probably!"

It was not supposed to happen.

The smoke detector (which they didn't know they had) started SCREECHING.

"WHAT IS THAT NOISE?" Bandit yelled from the dining area.

"THE SMOKE DETECTOR!" Mittens yelled back.

"WE HAVE A SMOKE DETECTOR?"

"APPARENTLY!"

Rascal waved a towel at the smoke detector, which made the smoke worse, which made the detector screech louder. Pete grabbed the fire extinguisher.

"NO!" Rascal shouted. "We need that for ACTUAL fires!"

"THIS MIGHT BECOME AN ACTUAL FIRE!"

"IT'S JUST SMOKE! SMOKE IS FINE! SMOKE MEANS FLAVOR!"

Outside, customers were starting to notice.

"Is something burning?" asked one of the chipmunks.

"It's part of the experience!" Mittens said quickly, though she was climbing down from her host stand to check on the kitchen. "Very authentic cooking methods!"

CRASH!

The door fell off its hinges again.

"THE DOOR!" everyone shouted.

"Leave it!" Rascal commanded. "Better ventilation for the smoke!"

A wise decision, accidentally made.

Somehow—and nobody was quite sure how—Rascal managed to produce food. It wasn't good food. It wasn't even mediocre food. But it was technically edible food-like substances on plates (and one on a piece of wood).

Bandit delivered everything to the tables while holding his breath and hoping for the best.

The squirrel family took a bite.

"This is AMAZING!" said the father squirrel.

Rascal poked his head out of the smoky kitchen. "It is?"

"It's the worst thing I've ever tasted!" the father continued enthusiastically.

"Oh."

"I LOVE IT! It's so weird! It's so bizarre! It's SO Chez Raccoon!" He turned to his kids. "This is what Fiona was talking about! This isn't food—it's an EXPERIENCE!"

The other customers, hearing this, started eating their meals with renewed enthusiasm. Even the mouse with the monocle, who'd ordered only water, asked to try some of the Mystery Balls (which were literally just bread rolled into balls with random things pressed into them).

"They like it?" Pete whispered, stunned.

"They think our incompetence is INTENTIONAL!" Rascal whispered back.

"Is that legal?"

"I DON'T KNOW BUT LET'S NOT QUESTION IT!"

More customers kept arriving. The line outside grew longer. At one point there were twelve animals trying to fit into a space designed for maybe four.

"We need more tables!" Mittens shouted.

"Use the shoes!" Rascal shouted back.

"WHAT?"

"THE DECORATIVE SHOES IN THE CORNER! TURN THEM INTO A TABLE!"

Mittens stared at the pile of old shoes. Then at the customers. Then back at the shoes.

She stacked them into a pyramid and put a board on top.

"SHOE TABLE IS READY!" she announced.

The turtle (who still thought this was a library) sat at the shoe table and seemed quite comfortable.

The hot plate stopped working entirely at this point, which was actually a blessing because it had been making concerning electrical noises. Rascal and Pete were now using only the camping stove and what Rascal called "ambient heat from panic."

"We're out of eggs!" Pete announced.

"Use the cheese!"

"We're out of cheese!"

"Use the bread!"

"We're almost out of bread!"

"Then we make something that doesn't NEED bread!"

"Like what?"

Rascal looked around frantically and spotted the can of multi-lingual beans. "BEAN SOUP!"

"We don't have soup bowls!"

"WE HAVE CUPS!"

They served bean soup in cups. The customers thought it was innovative.

A badger wearing a business suit took a sip and declared, "This is deconstructed gazpacho! Brilliant!"

It was absolutely not deconstructed gazpacho. It was beans. In a cup. Barely heated.

But nobody needed to know that.

At the peak of the chaos—with seventeen customers crammed into a space meant for four, the door on the ground, smoke still lingering in the air, and Rascal cooking with utensils he'd just invented—the mouse with the monocle stood up.

"EXCUSE ME!" he shouted in a surprisingly loud voice for such a small mouse. "I have an announcement!"

Everyone stopped and looked at him.

"My name is Mortimer P. Whiskerton III," he said formally. "I am a restaurant investor. I've been watching this establishment with great interest."

Rascal's heart stopped. An investor? Were they about to get sued? Inspected? Shut down?

"And I must say," Mortimer continued, adjusting his monocle, "this is the most chaotic, disorganized, health-code-violating establishment I have ever seen."

Rascal's heart sank.

"And I LOVE IT!" Mortimer pulled out a checkbook. "I would like to invest in Chez Raccoon!"

Rascal's heart did a loop-de-loop.

"You... you want to invest? In us?"

"Absolutely! This place has something special! It has CHARACTER! It has CHAOS! It has a table made of SHOES!" Mortimer wrote a check. "This is for five hundred dollars. Use it to fix your health violations, but whatever you do, DON'T change the essential weirdness of this place. That's what makes it special."

He handed the check to Rascal, who stared at it like it might disappear.

"Five... five hundred dollars?"

"Consider it a down payment. If you can pass your health inspection AND keep the chaos, I'll invest more to help you expand."

"Expand?" Mittens squeaked.

"Think bigger! More tables! Maybe even... TWO rooms!"

The four raccoons looked at each other with a mixture of terror and excitement.

"We can do that," Rascal said, though he had absolutely no idea if they could do that.

"Excellent!" Mortimer tipped his tiny hat. "I'll be back next week to see how you're progressing. Oh, and..." he leaned in conspiratorially, "the door falling off? Keep that. It's comedy gold."

And with that, Mortimer P. Whiskerton III paid for his water (and left a very generous tip) and left.

The restaurant continued in chaos for another three hours. By the time they closed for the day, they had served thirty-two customers, the kitchen was destroyed, they were out of literally every ingredient, and they'd made six hundred and forty-seven dollars.

They collapsed on the floor in exhaustion.

"We did it," Bandit panted.

"We're rich," Mittens wheezed.

"We're dying," Pete groaned.

"We're LEGENDARY!" Rascal said, though he was too tired to even lift his chef hat, which had fallen over his eyes again.

They lay there in the wreckage of their successful day: plates everywhere (including the piece of wood), the shoe table still standing proudly, the door still on the ground, and the lingering smell of whatever they'd been cooking.

"Four more days until inspection," Mittens said quietly.

"We can fix everything now," Pete said. "With five hundred dollars, we can actually pass."

"But Mortimer said not to change the essential weirdness," Bandit pointed out.

"So we need to pass inspection while staying weird," Rascal said slowly. "Is that even possible?"

"Probably not," Pete admitted.

"But when has that stopped us before?" Mittens asked.

All four raccoons started laughing. Tired, slightly hysterical laughing, but laughing nonetheless.

They'd survived their busiest day ever. They'd made more money than they'd ever seen. They had an actual investor (with a monocle!). And they had four days to figure out how to be officially safe while remaining unofficially ridiculous.

"Tomorrow," Rascal declared, still lying on the floor, "we become LEGITIMATE!"

"Can we sleep first?" Bandit asked.

"Obviously sleep first."

"Good. Because I can't move."

"Nobody move. Moving is cancelled."

They fell asleep right there on the kitchen floor, surrounded by the chaos they'd created, dreaming of a future where they had TWO hot plates and maybe even a table that wasn't made of shoes.

It was ridiculous.

It was impossible.

It was perfect.
