# The Celebrity Customer

It was Day Six, and Chez Raccoon was in crisis mode.

"We need forty-seven things to pass inspection and we have six dollars," Bandit said, counting their money for the third time. It was still six dollars.

"Maybe if we count it again, it'll be more," Mittens suggested hopefully.

"That's not how money works."

"Are you SURE?"

They had managed to fix exactly three violations: they'd found actual spoons (in a dumpster, but still), they'd propped the door back up (it fell down every hour, but it was UP when it mattered), and they'd moved the mystery item from the corner (they threw it away without ever figuring out what it was).

That left forty-four violations and six dollars.

"We're doomed," Rascal moaned into his chef hat.

"Maybe we should just give up," Mittens said sadly.

"Never!" Pete declared, which was surprising because Pete usually agreed with giving up. "We just need... we just need a miracle."

That's when the limousine pulled up outside.

Now, limousines didn't usually come to Maple Street. In fact, limousines had never come to Maple Street. Maple Street was where you went when you were lost and your GPS had given up on you.

But here was a limousine. A long, shiny, black limousine. And stepping out of it was the most elegant fox anyone had ever seen.

She wore a silver scarf. She had perfect fur. She carried herself like she owned the world, and maybe she did.

"Is that—" Mittens gasped.

"It can't be—" Bandit whispered.

"IT IS!" Rascal shrieked. "It's Fiona Foxworthy!"

Fiona Foxworthy was only the most famous food critic in the entire region. Her blog, "Fiona's Fancy Findings," could make or break a restaurant. She'd given bad reviews to places that had been in business for fifty years, and they'd closed within a week. She'd given good reviews to a hot dog cart, and it became a three-Michelin-star restaurant.

And she was walking toward their doorless doorway.

"EVERYBODY PANIC!" Rascal screamed.

"WE'RE ALREADY PANICKING!" Mittens screamed back.

"PANIC MORE!"

Fiona Foxworthy stepped delicately over the door-on-the-ground, ducking her head elegantly to avoid the doorframe. She looked around Chez Raccoon with eyes that had seen the finest restaurants in the world.

Those eyes now saw: one bucket-table, one washing machine host stand, a corner full of shoes, a camping stove, and four absolutely terrified raccoons.

"Charming," she said in a voice like honey and expensive wine.

"CH-CHARMING?" Mittens squeaked.

"Quite." Fiona pulled out a notebook with a little golden pen. "I heard about this place from a opossum named Oscar. He said it was the most memorable meal he'd ever had. I simply had to see it for myself."

"Oscar said that?" Rascal asked, remembering how Oscar had run away yelling about shoes and dumpsters.

"Oh yes. He was very... emphatic." Fiona smiled slightly. "I have a weakness for interesting restaurants. And this is certainly interesting."

"Would you like a table?" Mittens said in her fanciest voice, which came out about three octaves too high.

"Yes, please."

They only had one table. The bucket. Which was currently being used to store their six dollars and the violation list.

Bandit quickly dumped everything out and flipped the bucket over. "Your table, madam."

Fiona sat down gracefully, which is impressive when you're sitting on an upside-down bucket. She looked at the cardboard menu.

"Le Spécial du Jour," she read. "How intriguing. What is it today?"

Rascal ran to the kitchen and frantically looked at their supplies. They had: one egg, half a banana that was more brown than yellow, some crackers, and something that used to be a sandwich.

"It's... it's an AVANT-GARDE BREAKFAST EXPERIENCE!" he shouted.

"At four in the afternoon?"

"TIME IS A CONSTRUCT!"

"Fascinating," Fiona said, writing in her notebook. "I'll have that."

In the kitchen, Rascal was having a breakdown. "What do I do? WHAT DO I DO? This is Fiona Foxworthy! She's eaten at restaurants with SEVENTEEN Michelin stars!"

"There's only three Michelin stars maximum," Pete pointed out.

"THAT'S HOW FANCY SHE IS! SHE INVENTED MORE!"

"Just make something," Bandit urged. "Make it weird. Make it interesting. Make it... us."

Rascal looked at his ingredients. Then at his cooking stick. Then at his chef hat.

"Okay," he said, taking a deep breath. "Okay. If we're going down, we're going down as ourselves."

He scrambled the egg (on the camping stove, with the stick, obviously). He arranged the crackers in a circle on their one nice plate (which was still a frisbee, but it was a CLEAN frisbee). He sliced the brown banana and placed it artistically on top. Then he crumbled the old sandwich over everything like... like fancy cheese or something.

It looked absolutely ridiculous.

It looked perfect.

"SERVICE!" he called out.

Bandit carried it out like he was delivering the Crown Jewels. He placed it in front of Fiona with a flourish.

Fiona looked at the plate. She tilted her head. She leaned closer. She pulled out a magnifying glass—an actual magnifying glass—and examined the food.

"Interesting plating," she murmured. "The use of circular bread wafers as a foundation, the oxidized banana providing sweetness, the scrambled egg for protein, and..." she sniffed delicately, "is that... yesterday's tuna sandwich crumbled on top?"

"It's AGED tuna!" Rascal said quickly. "Very traditional!"

"Hmm." Fiona picked up their one fork (which was technically a spork, but nobody was mentioning that). She took a small, delicate bite.

Four raccoons held their breath.

Fiona chewed slowly. Thoughtfully. Her expression revealed nothing.

She swallowed.

She took another bite.

Then another.

Then she ate the entire thing.

"Well," she said finally, dabbing her mouth with a napkin she'd brought herself (because they didn't have napkins). "That was certainly the most peculiar meal I've had in years."

"Peculiar bad?" Rascal whispered.

"Peculiar..." Fiona paused, writing in her notebook. "...extraordinary."

"EXTRAORDINARY?" all four raccoons shouted.

"You see, I've eaten at the finest restaurants in the world. I've had caviar that costs more than a car. I've had desserts that take forty-eight hours to prepare. I've had meals where they serve you one artistic pea on a plate and call it cuisine." She stood up, smoothing her scarf. "But I have never, in all my years of food criticism, had a meal quite like this."

"So... you liked it?" Mittens asked nervously.

"Liked is the wrong word. I was... fascinated by it. You're not trying to be fancy. You're not trying to impress anyone. You're just four raccoons making food out of whatever you can find and somehow..." She smiled, a real smile this time. "Somehow it works. It's honest. It's weird. It's absolutely not up to health code—"

"We're working on that!" Rascal interjected.

"—but it's genuine. In a world of restaurants trying to be something they're not, you're a restaurant that knows exactly what it is." Fiona wrote more in her notebook. "I'm going to write about this place."

"You are?" Bandit's eyes went wide.

"Oh yes. My readers will either love it or think I've lost my mind. Either way, they'll come see for themselves." She pulled out a hundred-dollar bill. "For the meal and the experience."

Rascal stared at the money. "That's... that's too much. The menu said the special was eight dollars."

"Consider it an investment in art," Fiona said. She stepped over the door-on-the-ground and paused. "Oh, and gentlemen? And lady raccoon?"

"Yes?" they all said.

"Fix that door situation. It's charming once, but it will get old quickly."

And with that, Fiona Foxworthy got back into her limousine and drove away, leaving four stunned raccoons staring at a hundred-dollar bill.

"Did that just happen?" Bandit asked.

"I think so," Pete said.

"WE'RE SAVED!" Rascal jumped up and down. "We can buy a real door! And plates! And a refrigerator! Well, a small refrigerator! Well, maybe just a cooler! But a NICE cooler!"

"Guys," Mittens said, looking at her phone (which she'd found in a dumpster and somehow still worked). "You need to see this."

She held up the phone. On it was Fiona's blog, posted just minutes ago:

**"I Found the Strangest Restaurant in Town, and You Must Try It"**

*"Hidden on Maple Street is a restaurant that defies all logic, all convention, and approximately forty-seven health codes. Chez Raccoon is run by four raccoons who have no business running a restaurant, and that's precisely what makes it brilliant. The food is bizarre. The atmosphere is chaotic. The door is on the floor. And somehow, I loved every minute of it. Five stars for courage. Zero stars for health safety. Infinite stars for entertainment."*

"She gave us five stars!" Mittens shrieked.

"And zero stars," Bandit added.

"But also infinite stars!" Pete pointed out.

"I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT I LOVE IT!" Rascal shouted.

Already, the comments were flooding in:

*"I HAVE to see this place!"*
*"Four raccoons running a restaurant? I'm there!"*
*"The door is on the FLOOR? Amazing!"*
*"Is this safe?"*
*"Who cares if it's safe, it sounds hilarious!"*

"This is it," Rascal said, clutching the hundred-dollar bill. "This is our chance. Fiona gave us publicity. Now we need to use this money to fix enough violations to pass that inspection."

"Can we really fix forty-four violations with a hundred dollars?" Mittens asked.

"No," Pete said honestly. "But we can probably fix twenty-two violations. And maybe if we're clever, we can make the other twenty-two less obvious."

"That's not how inspections work," Bandit said.

"IT IS NOW!" Rascal declared. "Come on, team! We've got six days until Inspector Wingspan comes back! We're going to turn this place into a... into a slightly-less-health-code-violating establishment!"

"That's not very catchy," Mittens pointed out.

"WE'LL WORK ON THE SLOGAN LATER!"

They spent the rest of the evening making a shopping list:
- Real door (crucial)
- Real plates (important)
- Actual cooking utensils (probably necessary)
- Food thermometer (apparently you're supposed to check temperatures?)
- Cleaning supplies (boring but required)
- Small refrigerator (if they could find a cheap one)
- Fire extinguisher (just in case)

"This is going to take all hundred dollars," Bandit calculated.

"Then we'd better make more money before inspection day," Rascal said. "Because if Fiona's review brings in customers tomorrow, we're going to be BUSY."

"Should we be worried that we're not ready?" Mittens asked.

"Oh, we're DEFINITELY not ready," Pete agreed.

"But when has that stopped us before?" Rascal grinned.

"Literally never," Bandit said.

"EXACTLY!"

Outside, the moon was rising over Maple Street. In her limousine, Fiona Foxworthy was already planning her next review. In his house, Oscar was reading Fiona's blog and feeling vindicated. And in her office, Inspector Wingspan was setting her alarm for the re-inspection in six days, certain she'd be shutting them down.

But inside Chez Raccoon, four raccoons were counting their money, planning their improvements, and dreaming of the day when they'd have TWO buckets for tables.

It was probably going to be a disaster.

But it was going to be THEIR disaster.

And sometimes, that's all you need.
