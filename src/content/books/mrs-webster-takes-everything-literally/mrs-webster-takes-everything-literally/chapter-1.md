# The Warnings

On my first day at Brookdale Elementary, three different kids warned me about Mrs. Webster. I should have listened.

The first warning came from a girl named Destiny at the lockers. She had braids with little purple beads that clicked when she moved her head, and she looked at me like I was walking into a burning building.

"You're the new kid, right? Marcus?"

"Yeah," I said, shoving my backpack into my locker. "How'd you know?"

"Small school." She leaned in close. "Listen. You have Mrs. Webster for fourth period. Whatever you do, *don't use idioms*."

I blinked at her. "Don't use what?"

"Idioms. You know, like 'break a leg' or 'piece of cake' or—" She stopped herself, looking around nervously. "Just... say exactly what you mean. Nothing else. Trust me."

Before I could ask what she was talking about, she clicked away down the hall.

The second warning came from a random kid at the water fountain. He was short, had glasses, and spoke in a whisper.

"Hey. New kid. Mrs. Webster's class?"

"Yeah?"

"She makes everything weird. Just... be careful."

Then he was gone.

The third warning came from a tall kid named Kevin who cornered me outside the classroom door. He had the look of someone who'd seen things. Terrible things.

"Dude," he said. "She's actually insane."

"Who, Mrs. Webster?"

"Last month, Tyler said he was going to 'hit the books' and she handed him an actual dictionary and told him to swing hard." Kevin shook his head slowly. "He got detention for property damage."

I laughed. "That's a good prank."

Kevin didn't laugh. "It wasn't a prank."

I figured the kids at Brookdale Elementary were just messing with the new guy. Classic move. Make up some wild story about a teacher, watch the new kid panic. I wasn't going to fall for it.

Mrs. Webster seemed completely normal. She had silver-streaked hair in a neat bun, reading glasses on a beaded chain, and a cardigan with patches on the elbows. She smiled warmly when I introduced myself and showed me to my desk. Her voice was kind. Her handwriting on the board was perfect.

*These kids are ridiculous*, I thought. *She's the most normal teacher I've ever had*.

The class went fine. We read a poem about the ocean. We discussed metaphors (which are apparently different from idioms, but I still wasn't totally clear on either). Mrs. Webster asked good questions and actually listened to the answers.

See? Normal.

Then, at the end of class, my stomach growled. Loudly.

Mrs. Webster looked up. "Hungry, Mr. Chen?"

"Starving," I said, without thinking. "I could eat a horse."

The room went silent. Every single kid turned to look at me. Destiny's beads froze mid-click. Kevin slowly put his head down on his desk.

Mrs. Webster adjusted her glasses, and I could have sworn I saw the corner of her mouth twitch.

"A horse," she said thoughtfully. "That's quite an appetite. Would you prefer it grilled or roasted? I should warn you, the cafeteria doesn't typically stock horse, but I could make some calls. There's a farm two towns over. Do you have any allergies? Would you like hay on the side?"

I stared at her.

She stared back, perfectly pleasant, pen poised over her notebook as if she was genuinely ready to write down my order.

"I... I didn't mean..."

"Of course, we'd need parental permission for that kind of meal," she continued. "It's quite a large portion. Should I send a note home?"

"No! I just—I meant I'm really hungry. Regular hungry. For regular food."

"Ah." She smiled and set down her pen. "Then might I suggest the cafeteria's Tuesday special? I hear the meatloaf is acceptable."

The bell rang. Kids scrambled for the door. As I walked out, dazed, I glanced back.

Mrs. Webster was writing something in a small leather notebook. And I could have sworn—just for a second—she was smiling.

Not a confused smile. Not a *what a strange boy* smile.

A satisfied smile.

Like she'd just won something.
