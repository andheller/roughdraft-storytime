# Operation: Outsmart the Teacher

The plan was simple: speak like a robot, avoid all idioms, and prove that Mrs. Webster couldn't twist *perfectly literal* statements.

Day One was a success.

"May I please use the restroom?" I asked.

"Of course, Mr. Chen," she said. No twinkle. No twist. Just a normal answer.

*Ha*, I thought. *I'm winning*.

"May I please sharpen my pencil at the designated pencil-sharpening station?"

"Certainly."

Destiny gave me a thumbs-up from across the room. Kevin looked confused, but Kevin always looked confused.

Day Two was also a success. I spoke in complete, literal sentences. I said "I don't understand this math problem" instead of "this is making my head spin." I said "I'd like to ask a question" instead of "can I pick your brain?"

Mrs. Webster watched me with what I can only describe as *interest*. But she didn't do anything.

By Day Three, I was feeling confident. Maybe too confident.

"Mrs. Webster?" I said. "I need to get my notebook from my bag."

She tilted her head. Adjusted her glasses.

*Uh oh.*

"Which bag, Mr. Chen?"

"What?"

"Which bag? Paper bag? Plastic bag? Sleeping bag? Punching bag?" She pulled out a notepad. "I'll need you to be more specific. The school has a diverse collection of bags. I wouldn't want to bring you the wrong one."

"My... my backpack. The bag on my back. That I brought to school. With my stuff in it."

"Ah. The personal carrying device you transport on your shoulders. Why didn't you say so?"

She smiled. There was the twinkle.

*She's changing the rules*, I realized. *She knows I know*.

At lunch, I told Destiny what happened.

"She took a LITERAL statement literally," I said. "That's not even fair. 'Bag' is a word. It means bag!"

"Maybe she's testing you," Destiny said. "To see how far you'll go."

"Or maybe she knows I'm onto her."

"Marcus." Destiny leaned forward. "Have you considered just... asking her?"

"Asking her what? 'Hey, are you pretending to misunderstand us on purpose?' She'll just take THAT literally too."

"Then you word it carefully. Really carefully."

I thought about it. She was right. The only way to get a real answer was to ask a question she couldn't twist.

But first, I needed more evidence.

That afternoon, I tried again.

"Mrs. Webster? I want to answer the question."

"Which question, Mr. Chen? There are many questions in the universe. 'What is the meaning of life?' 'Why is the sky blue?' 'Where do socks go when they disappear from the dryer?' You'll need to be specific."

"The question. The one you just asked. The one about the Declaration of Independence."

"Ah. That question." She nodded. "Please proceed."

I answered the question. She marked it correct. And then she did something she'd never done before.

She looked right at me. Held my gaze. And her left eye—I swear on my entire pencil collection—*almost winked*.

Not a full wink. Just a tiny flicker. A muscle movement. The ghost of a wink.

But I saw it.

After class, she called me up to her desk.

"Mr. Chen," she said. "You've been speaking very... precisely lately."

"Thank you?"

"It wasn't entirely a compliment." She folded her hands. "Precision is important, but so is creativity. Language is meant to be played with."

"Played with?"

The twinkle was back. Full force.

"Just an observation," she said. "You may go."

I walked to the door. Then I stopped.

"Mrs. Webster?"

"Yes, Mr. Chen?"

"Tomorrow," I said. "After class. I have a question for you. A very carefully worded question."

She smiled. The real smile, not the customer-service one.

"I look forward to it," she said.

And I knew—right then—that she knew exactly what I was going to ask.

And she was going to answer honestly.

Because for some reason, after eight years of waiting, Mrs. Webster had finally found someone who figured out the game.
