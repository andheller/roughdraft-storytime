# The Confession

I stayed after class.

Destiny had offered to wait outside, but I told her this was something I needed to do alone. She nodded and said, "Good luck. And I mean that the regular way, not the breaking-legs way."

Mrs. Webster was erasing the board when the last student left. She didn't turn around, but I could tell she knew I was there.

"Mr. Chen," she said. "Your carefully worded question?"

I'd practiced this. All night. Every word.

"Mrs. Webster," I said. "I have observed that when students use figurative language, you respond with literal interpretations. I have also observed that you use figurative language correctly when teaching. My question is this: Is this behavior intentional?"

She stopped erasing. Set down the eraser. Turned around slowly.

For a moment, she just looked at me. No twinkle. No smile. Just... consideration.

Then she took off her glasses.

"Mr. Chen," she said. "You're the first student in eight years to figure it out."

I let out a breath I didn't know I'd been holding.

"So it IS on purpose."

"Oh, absolutely." She sat down at her desk and gestured for me to pull up a chair. A real chair. Not take it somewhere.

"Why?" I asked.

She laughed. It was a nice laugh, warmer than I expected.

"Because it's *fun*, Marcus. Because after fifteen years of teaching, I needed something to keep me entertained." She leaned back. "And because—and this is the part nobody believes—it actually works."

"Works how?"

She reached into her desk and pulled out a leather notebook. Not the small one she wrote in during class—a bigger one, worn at the edges, stuffed with papers and photos and sticky notes.

"Fifteen years of this," she said, opening it. "Fifteen years of 'piece of cake' and 'break a leg' and 'hold your horses.'"

I looked at the pages. There were notes in neat handwriting. *Tyler, September 2019: "hit the books" - handed him a dictionary.* *Aisha, March 2022: "raining cats and dogs" - spent ten minutes at the window.* *Kevin, basically every week: everything.*

"You keep track of all of it?"

"I keep track of the good ones." She turned to a page near the back. "Here's the thing, Marcus. I used to teach college. English literature. Very serious, very proper. And do you know what I discovered? Nobody laughed. Nobody remembered anything. I'd teach metaphors and similes and the next week, blank stares."

She closed the notebook.

"Then I came here. Fourth grade. And on my very first day, a student told me she was 'all ears.' And I thought—just for fun—what if I took that literally? So I did. And the whole class laughed. And the next week, when we talked about idioms, every single student remembered what 'all ears' meant. Because they remembered me being ridiculous."

"So it's educational?"

"It's hilarious AND educational," she said. "But mostly hilarious. I won't lie to you, Marcus. I do it because it makes me happy. Watching you all try to outsmart me? That's the best part of my day."

I thought about all the times she'd gotten me. The horse. The pencil lending terms. The bags.

"So you're never going to stop."

"Why would I stop? I'm having the time of my life." She paused. "Also, I'm genuinely curious—would you prefer your horse grilled or roasted? You never answered."

I laughed. I couldn't help it.

"Mrs. Webster," I said. "You're kind of a genius."

"Please." She waved her hand. "I'm just a teacher who pays attention to words. Which, by the way, you've started doing too. Have you noticed that? You speak more carefully now. You think before you talk."

I hadn't noticed. But she was right.

"Is that... was that part of the plan?"

She smiled the real smile again. "Words matter, Marcus. Every single one. If I have to make a fool of myself to teach you that, well..." She shrugged. "I'm happy to take one for the team."

I stood up to leave. Then stopped.

"Are you going to tell everyone? That I figured it out?"

"That's up to you," she said. "You can tell whoever you want. But I should warn you—knowing the secret doesn't make you immune. I'll still get you. I'm very, very good at this."

I thought about it. About Destiny, who spoke like a robot. About Kevin, who would never figure it out. About all the future kids who would walk into this classroom and get warned about Mrs. Webster.

"I think I'll keep it to myself," I said. "It's funnier that way."

Mrs. Webster's twinkle returned, brighter than ever.

"Welcome to the club, Mr. Chen."
