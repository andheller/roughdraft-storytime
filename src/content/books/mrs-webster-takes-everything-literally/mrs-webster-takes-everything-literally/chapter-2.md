# Learning the Hard Way

By Friday, I had made four mistakes. Each one worse than the last.

**Monday**: We were discussing the American Revolution, and Mrs. Webster asked if anyone had questions. I raised my hand and said, "I'm all ears."

She stopped mid-sentence. Adjusted her glasses. Tilted her head.

"All ears?" she repeated. "My goodness, Mr. Chen. That sounds like a serious medical condition. Should I call your parents? The school nurse? Ears are important, but you do need other body parts. A brain, for instance. Lungs. Perhaps a spleen."

The class giggled. I sank into my chair.

"I just meant I'm listening," I mumbled.

"Ah," she said. "Then perhaps say *that* next time."

**Tuesday**: I needed to borrow a pencil. Destiny tried to stop me—actually grabbed my arm—but I'd already said it.

"Mrs. Webster? Can I lend you my pencil? I mean—can you lend me—wait—"

Too late.

She pulled out a small notepad. "Certainly, Mr. Chen. Standard lending terms apply. The pencil will be due back by end of class. Interest rate is two percent, payable in eraser shavings. Late returns will incur a fee of one mechanical pencil lead per day. Do you accept these terms?"

"I just need to write my name on the worksheet."

"The terms, Mr. Chen?"

"...I accept."

She handed me the pencil with a completely straight face. But when I looked up, she was writing in that leather notebook again.

**Wednesday**: Destiny coached me at lunch.

"Okay," she said, stabbing her tater tots with a fork. "Here's the deal. Only say exactly what you mean. No expressions. No figures of speech. If you're tired, don't say 'I'm dead tired.' Don't say 'I could sleep for a year.' Say 'I am experiencing fatigue.'"

"That sounds like a robot."

"Better a robot than whatever Kevin is." She pointed across the cafeteria, where Kevin was loudly complaining to his friends. "He says an idiom like once an hour. He never learns. Last week he told her he was 'feeling under the weather' and she offered him an umbrella."

I practiced. I was going to be careful.

**Thursday**: It was raining. Hard.

I walked into class, dripping wet, and before I could stop myself, I said, "Wow, it's really raining cats and dogs out there."

Mrs. Webster went to the window. She looked outside for a long, long moment. Then she turned back to me with what I can only describe as disappointment.

"I don't see any cats, Mr. Chen. Or dogs. Just rain." She sighed. "What a shame. I do enjoy animals."

"It's just an expression—"

"Perhaps you heard barking? The wind can sound like barking sometimes."

"I didn't—"

"I'll keep watching. Just in case."

She stared out the window for the entire reading period. Every few minutes, she'd murmur, "Still no dogs."

**Friday**: The worst one.

I was trying to move desks and I said—without thinking, because apparently I never think—"Hey, Mrs. Webster? Could you take a seat?"

She picked up the chair next to her. Lifted it right off the ground.

"Certainly. Where would you like me to take it? The principal's office? The cafeteria? The parking lot seems inconvenient, but I'm willing to make the walk."

"I meant—"

"The gymnasium? There's a basketball game tonight. They might need extra seating."

"Please put the chair down."

She set it down gently. Smiled. Wrote something in her notebook.

And that's when I noticed it.

She adjusted her glasses *before* I finished speaking. The mouth twitch happened *before* she delivered the response. She always knew what was coming. She was always ready.

Too ready.

"Hey," I said to Destiny after class. "Does Mrs. Webster seem... fast to you?"

"What do you mean?"

"Like, she always has the perfect response. Immediately. It's like she knows what we're going to say before we say it."

Destiny frowned. "I mean, she's been teaching for a while..."

"No, that's not—" I struggled to explain. "Today she picked up the chair before I finished my sentence. She was already reaching for it."

Destiny was quiet for a moment.

"Marcus," she said slowly. "Are you saying you think she's doing it on purpose?"

I looked back at the classroom. Mrs. Webster was erasing the board, humming quietly to herself.

"I don't know yet," I said. "But I'm going to find out."
