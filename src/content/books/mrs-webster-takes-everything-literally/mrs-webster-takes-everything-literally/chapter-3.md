# The Webster Twinkle

I decided to stop talking and start watching.

For one whole week, I didn't use a single idiom. I spoke like Destiny—careful, precise, almost robotic. "May I please use the restroom?" instead of "I gotta run." "The assignment is difficult" instead of "This is killing me."

It was exhausting. But it let me pay attention to everyone else.

And that's when I saw it.

On Tuesday, Kevin finished his math test early. He leaned back in his chair, stretched, and announced to no one in particular, "That test was a piece of cake."

Mrs. Webster didn't even look up from her desk. She just reached into her bottom drawer—the one she never opened—and pulled out a small Tupperware container.

Inside was a slice of chocolate cake.

"Would you like a fork, Kevin?" she asked, setting it on his desk. "Since the test was a piece of cake, it only seems fair that you should have one."

Kevin stared at the cake. Then at her. Then at the cake again.

"I... what?"

"The cake, Kevin. You said the test was cake. Here it is. Enjoy."

She'd had cake in her desk. *Ready*. Like she knew someone would say it.

I wrote in my notebook: *Prepared in advance. Evidence of planning.*

On Wednesday, a girl named Sophie was nervous about the school play. She was playing a tree, which doesn't seem like a hard role, but Sophie was very serious about it.

"Wish me luck, Mrs. Webster," she said. "I'm about to go break a leg!"

Mrs. Webster's hand was already moving toward the phone. *Before Sophie finished the sentence.*

"Break a leg?" Mrs. Webster lifted the receiver. "That sounds terribly painful. Should I call an ambulance? The hospital? Your parents will want to know about your plans."

"No! I meant—it's theater—it means good luck!"

"Does it? How odd. It sounds like it means 'break a leg.'" She set down the phone. "Perhaps the theater should reconsider its vocabulary."

I wrote: *Phone in hand before sentence ended. Anticipation.*

On Thursday, I made my biggest discovery.

We were talking about the Revolutionary War again, and Mrs. Webster used an idiom. She said the colonists "let the cat out of the bag" when they revealed their plans to the British.

A normal idiom. Used correctly.

She knew what it meant. She *knew*.

"Mrs. Webster," I said, carefully. "What does 'let the cat out of the bag' mean?"

She smiled. "It means to reveal a secret, Mr. Chen. It comes from a old marketplace trick where sellers would—" She stopped. Looked at me. Really looked at me, for the first time.

Something flickered in her eyes. A sparkle. A gleam.

And then it was gone, and she continued the lesson.

But I'd seen it. I'd *seen* it.

At lunch, I showed Destiny my notes.

"Look," I said. "She knows every idiom. She uses them correctly when she's teaching. She only pretends not to understand when *we* use them."

Destiny read through my observations. Her eyebrows went up.

"The cake," she said. "She had *cake* in her desk?"

"Ready to go. Tupperware and everything."

"That's... actually kind of impressive."

"And there's something else." I pointed to my last note. "When she does it—right before she responds—there's this thing in her eyes. This... sparkle. Like she's about to tell a joke and she's trying not to laugh."

Destiny looked at me. "What are you calling it?"

I hadn't thought about that. But now, looking at my notes, there was only one thing to call it.

"The Webster Twinkle," I said. "That's her tell. That's how you know she's about to do it."

Destiny was quiet for a long moment. Then she nodded slowly.

"Okay," she said. "I believe you. So what do we do about it?"

I thought about it. If she needed idioms to twist, then the way to prove it—and maybe beat her—was to stop giving her ammunition.

"We stop using idioms entirely," I said. "We speak like robots. Perfectly literal, perfectly precise. If I'm right, she won't be able to do anything."

"And if you're wrong?"

I closed my notebook. "Then at least I'll stop embarrassing myself five times a week."

Destiny grinned. "Operation: Outsmart the Teacher?"

"Operation: Outsmart the Teacher."

The operation, it turned out, was harder than I expected.

And Mrs. Webster was ready for it.
