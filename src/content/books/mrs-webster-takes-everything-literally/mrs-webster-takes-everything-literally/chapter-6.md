# The Secret Keeper

Being a secret keeper is harder than it sounds.

I couldn't tell Destiny the whole truth—just that Mrs. Webster and I had "come to an understanding." Destiny accepted this with a nod and went back to her robot-speech, which honestly was getting kind of impressive. Last week she asked to "relocate to the hydration station for the purpose of consuming water," and Mrs. Webster had no choice but to say yes.

Kevin, of course, never figured it out. And never would.

"This class is driving me up the wall!" he announced one Tuesday, after getting another question wrong.

Mrs. Webster looked at the wall thoughtfully. "That seems dangerous, Kevin. Walls are quite vertical. Should I notify the maintenance department?"

"I didn't mean—"

"Perhaps they could install handles? For your climbing convenience?"

Kevin groaned. I caught Mrs. Webster's eye across the room. She winked. I bit my lip to keep from laughing.

The weird thing was, knowing the secret didn't make me immune. Mrs. Webster still got me, almost every day. But now it felt different. Like we were playing a game together, instead of her playing a game on me.

"I could use a hand with these papers," I said one afternoon, purely to see what she'd do.

Without missing a beat, she walked to the science corner, reached into the skeleton model, and detached its plastic hand.

"Will this do?"

"Perfect," I said, taking the skeleton hand and using it to wave at Destiny, who stared at me like I'd lost my mind.

Three weeks later, a new kid showed up.

Her name was Emma. She had red hair and freckles and looked absolutely terrified, the way all new kids look on their first day. I remembered that feeling. The lockers, the hallways, the lunch tables where you don't know anyone.

At recess, I watched the other kids swarm her with warnings.

"Whatever you do, don't use idioms—"

"She takes EVERYTHING literally—"

"One time she called a farm about a horse—"

Emma nodded along, eyes wide, probably thinking the same thing I'd thought: *These kids are pranking me*.

Destiny appeared at my shoulder.

"Are you going to tell her the truth?"

I watched Emma receive warning after warning. I thought about my first day. About the horse, the cake, the Webster Twinkle. About sitting in Mrs. Webster's classroom and finally understanding.

"Where's the fun in that?" I said.

Destiny smiled. "You're starting to sound like her."

I walked over to Emma.

"Hey. New kid?"

"Yeah." She looked at me nervously. "Emma."

"I'm Marcus. I was new a few months ago." I paused. "About Mrs. Webster..."

"The literal teacher? Everyone keeps warning me."

"Yeah, well." I shrugged. "You should definitely listen to them."

"Is she really that weird?"

I thought about it. About the fifteen years of notes. About the twinkle. About a teacher who found a way to make fourth grade the best part of her day.

"She's exactly that weird," I said. "Every word of it."

Emma didn't look reassured. But she would figure it out. Or she wouldn't. Either way, Mrs. Webster would have fun.

In class that afternoon, Mrs. Webster welcomed Emma with a warm smile.

"Wonderful to have you, Emma. I'm so glad you could join us."

"Thanks," Emma said nervously. "I'm, um, happy to be here?"

Mrs. Webster tilted her head. Adjusted her glasses.

*Here we go*, I thought.

"Happy to be *here*?" Mrs. Webster said. "What an interesting phrase. Where exactly is 'here'? This classroom? This school? This planet? 'Here' is quite relative, Emma. Perhaps you should clarify."

Emma's mouth opened. Closed. Opened again.

From across the room, Mrs. Webster caught my eye and winked.

I winked back.

Then she returned to the lesson, and I returned to my notes, and Emma began her education in the most important subject at Brookdale Elementary:

Choosing your words very, very carefully.

*THE END*

*(But not THE END as in "the conclusion of all things"—just THE END of this particular story. Mrs. Webster would want me to clarify.)*
