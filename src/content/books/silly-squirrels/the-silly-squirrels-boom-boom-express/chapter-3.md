# Grandma's Little Gift

The day was done.

Every package in Nutville had been delivered. Sure, most of them were delivered to the WRONG places. And yes, several things had exploded. And okay fine, there were now seventeen new craters around town.

But the Boom-Boom Express had DELIVERED.

Now, finally, the squirrel family sat around the little box from Grandma.

"Okay," Mama said carefully. "After all we went through to protect this... let's open it VERY gently."

Papa nodded seriously.

Nutty held his breath.

Mama slowly untied the ribbon.

She carefully peeled back the paper.

She lifted the lid of the box and...

TNT.

The box was full of TNT.

Lots and lots and LOTS of TNT.

There was a little note on top:

*"Dear sweeties! Heard about your little train! I found these in the old mine and thought you could use MORE SUPPLIES! Have fun! Don't blow up anything important!*

*Love and booms,*
*Grandma Nutwobble*

*P.S. - I also sent some cookies but they're in a different box. That one might have exploded. Sorry about your mailbox."*

The three squirrels looked at each other.

They looked at the TNT.

They looked at the Boom-Boom Express, which was currently smoking and missing two wheels.

"You know," Papa said slowly, "the train COULD go faster..."

"With MORE power..." Nutty added.

"We could deliver packages to the NEXT COUNTRY!" Mama whispered.

---

Three towns over, Grandma Nutwobble sat on her porch with a cup of acorn tea.

She waited.

**BOOOOOOOOOOM!**

The biggest boom she'd ever heard echoed across the valley. Birds flew from trees. Windows rattled. A mushroom cloud shaped like a squirrel rose over Nutville.

Grandma smiled and sipped her tea.

"That's my family."

**THE END**
