# All Aboard the Boom-Boom!

Nutville had a problem.

"My acorn cookies took THREE WHOLE DAYS to arrive!" complained Mrs. Hedgehog.

"My birthday invitations got there AFTER my birthday!" grumbled the Mayor.

"My package of socks is still somewhere... out there," sighed Mr. Chipmunk, wiggling his cold toes.

Nutty, Mama, and Papa listened to everyone complain at the town meeting. The mail cart was just too slow. The delivery squirrel was doing his best, but he only had tiny legs!

"We need something FASTER!" declared the Mayor.

Papa's eyes went wide. His whiskers twitched. He got The Look.

Mama knew The Look. "Oh no."

"Oh YES!" Papa shouted. "I know EXACTLY what Nutville needs!"

The next morning, everyone gathered at the edge of town.

There sat... a thing.

It was made of old acorn shells welded together. It had pinecone wheels. It had a smokestack made from a hollow stick. And strapped to the back were seventeen sticks of TNT.

"BEHOLD!" Papa announced proudly. "The BOOM-BOOM EXPRESS!"

"Why is it called the Boom-Boom Express?" asked Mrs. Hedgehog nervously.

**BOOM!**

The train shot forward in a blast of smoke and fire. It zoomed past the station. It zoomed past the town square. It zoomed past the "Welcome to Nutville" sign and kept going.

Three miles later, it finally stopped in a corn field two towns over.

Nutty pulled a piece of corn from his ear. "Well. That was fast."

"Maybe," Mama coughed through the smoke, "maybe just a LITTLE less TNT next time?"

Papa was already scribbling in his notebook. "Less TNT? No no no. We just need better BRAKES!"

He did not add better brakes.

He added more TNT.

The Boom-Boom Express was officially open for business.

Nutville would never be the same.
