# Special Delivery... KABOOM!

Day one of the Boom-Boom Express delivery service started with a bang.

Actually, it started with seven bangs, two crashes, and one very surprised goat.

"DELIVERY FOR MRS. HEDGEHOG!" Nutty shouted as the train screeched to a stop. Well, "stop" was generous. It was more of a "violent crashing into a tree" situation.

"My teacups!" Mrs. Hedgehog gasped.

Nutty handed her a box. She opened it and found... powder.

"That's... that's dust."

"Teacup dust!" Papa said cheerfully. "Delivered in record time! Please sign here."

**BOOM!**

"Birthday cake for the Mayor!" Mama announced.

The Mayor looked around. "Where is it?"

Mama pointed at the sky. Waaaaay off in the distance, something was flying through the clouds.

"It's in Acornville now! Should arrive in about... three seconds."

A distant *splat* echoed across the valley.

"Someone in Acornville is having a GREAT day," Papa nodded.

Between explosions, one package sat in the corner of the train car.

It was small. It was wrapped in brown paper. And it had a label that said:

**FRAGILE - HANDLE WITH CARE**

"What's in it?" Nutty asked.

"Dunno," Papa shrugged. "But we better not break it!"

**BOOM!**

The train launched sideways. Mama dove across the car and caught the fragile box before it hit the wall.

**CRASH!**

They hit a boulder. Nutty grabbed the box and rolled under a seat to protect it.

**KABOOM!**

The entire back of the train exploded. Papa shielded the package with his body like it was his own child.

"Who is this even for?!" Mama wheezed.

Papa looked at the label.

"Oh. It's for US. From Grandma."

They all stared at the little box.

"We should probably open it," Nutty said.

"Definitely," Mama agreed.

"After ONE more delivery!" Papa said, reaching for the TNT.

**BOOM!**
