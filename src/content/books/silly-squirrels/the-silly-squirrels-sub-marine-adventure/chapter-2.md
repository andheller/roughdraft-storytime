# The Bark Boat Blunder

The next morning, Nutty woke up with his thinking cap on - which was actually just his regular cap, but he wore it extra thoughtfully.

"I've got it!" he announced at breakfast, waving a piece of toast shaped like a submarine. "Our problem yesterday was we used materials that soak up water. So today, we use something that **repels** water!"

"What did you have in mind, sweetie?" Mama asked, though she had a suspicion she knew where this was going.

"Tree bark! It protects trees from rain, so it must be waterproof, right?"

Papa nodded approvingly. "Now that's scientific thinking! Bark it is!"

After breakfast, the family spent the morning carefully peeling bark from fallen branches (they were very careful not to hurt any living trees, of course). They found beautiful pieces - some smooth birch bark that looked almost like paper, some rough oak bark with interesting ridges, and some bouncy pine bark that smelled like Christmas.

"This time," Mama declared, holding up a piece of birch bark, "we'll make a proper plan first!"

Nutty sketched their design on a flat piece of bark with a charcoal stick: "See? We make a canoe shape, but then we cover the top with more bark to make it fully enclosed! And we'll use tree sap as glue instead of just tying things together!"

"Brilliant!" Papa exclaimed. "And look - this bark naturally curves. It's like nature designed it for boat building!"

---

Several hours later, they stood admiring their handiwork. Their bark submarine looked significantly more submarine-like than the leaf disaster. It had a proper hull, a sealed top, and even a small bark periscope that Nutty had cleverly carved himself.

"Now this," Papa said proudly, "looks like it could actually go underwater!"

"It's even got that satisfying submarine smell," Mama added, sniffing the piney aroma.

At the riverbank, they carefully lowered their bark creation into the water. Unlike yesterday's immediate sinking, this one actually floated! Not only that, it looked almost... professional.

"Success!" Nutty cheered. "Quick, let's get in before it changes its mind!"

---

The three squirrels squeezed into their bark submarine through a small opening in the top. It was cozy - very cozy. Actually, it was more like sardines-in-a-can cozy.

"Everyone ready for underwater exploration?" Papa asked, though his voice was muffled because his face was pressed against a piece of bark.

"Ready!" came two equally muffled replies.

Papa reached for their diving mechanism: a collection of small rocks they'd brought as ballast. "Dive! Dive! Dive!"

The submarine began to sink as planned. Down they went, and down, and down...

"This is amazing!" Nutty squeaked. "I can see fish through the bark cracks! There's a turtle! There's a... oh."

"Oh?" Mama asked.

"Oh no," Nutty corrected.

The submarine was indeed going down, but it wasn't stopping. Worse, it was taking on water through tiny gaps between the bark pieces. Not quickly, but steadily.

"Uh, Papa?" Nutty said, watching water trickle in around his feet. "I think our submarine is becoming more of a... submarine-and-swimming-pool combination."

Papa tried to reach the emergency ballast release (more rocks to drop), but he was wedged between Mama and a curved piece of oak bark. "I can't... quite... reach..."

*Glub glub.*

More water seeped in.

"Well," Mama said with forced cheer as water reached their ankles, "at least this time we're sinking slowly enough to appreciate the experience!"

Ten minutes later, three very wet and very bark-covered squirrels sat on the riverbank, watching their second submarine attempt bob half-submerged nearby.

Gerald's grumpy face surfaced next to the half-sunk bark boat. He examined it with the weary expression of a landlord discovering his tenants have been throwing furniture out the window.

"Another one?" he asked flatly.

"We almost made it work this time!" Nutty said defensively.

"Uh-huh." Gerald swam a slow circle around the bark boat. "You know your leaf pile from yesterday? A family of minnows has already moved in. They're calling it 'The Leaf Loft.' They put up curtains."

"Really?" Mama asked, surprised.

"Little seaweed curtains. Very tasteful." Gerald sighed. "I give it three days before your bark contraption here becomes 'The Bark Bed & Breakfast.' The local fish are already forming a waiting list for Nutwobble-brand disaster housing."

"We're not trying to build fish houses!" Nutty protested.

"And yet," Gerald said dryly, "you're so good at it."

"The good news," Papa said, picking bark chips out of his whiskers, "is that we made it underwater!"

"The bad news," Mama added, wringing water from her tail, "is that we also made it back to the surface rather urgently."

Nutty stared at their bark boat, which was now more of a bark bath. "It was **so close** to working! We just need to figure out how to make it completely watertight."

Gerald's head was still poking above the surface. "You could always stop. Just throwing that out there. As an option. That exists."

"Never!" Nutty declared.

"Didn't think so." Gerald sank back down, muttering something about "stubborn mammals" and "property values."

"And maybe a bit roomier," Papa suggested, still feeling cramped.

"And with a better emergency exit plan," Mama noted.

As they walked home, leaving another failed submarine bobbing in the river, Nutty was already deep in thought about Submarine Number Three.

"You know what, family?" he said, his optimism returning. "We're getting better at this! Yesterday we lasted about ten seconds underwater. Today we lasted almost ten minutes!"

"That's the spirit!" Papa laughed. "At this rate, by Submarine Number Five, we'll be ready for the Golden Acorn!"

"Tomorrow," Nutty declared, "we think bigger!"
