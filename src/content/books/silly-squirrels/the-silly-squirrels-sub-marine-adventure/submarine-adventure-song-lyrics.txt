THE SILLY SQUIRRELS SUBMARINE SONG
"Dive, Dive, Dive Again!"

[VERSE 1]
Nutty heard a story from the wise old owl
'Bout a Golden Acorn, magic and bright
Hidden deep beneath the river so deep
Glowing like sunshine, such a wonderful sight!
"Let's build a submarine!" he cried with glee
"Mama, Papa, come explore with me!"

[CHORUS]
Dive, dive, dive again!
Silly Squirrels submarine crew!
Build it up, splash it down
Try until our dreams come true!
Dive, dive, dive again!
Nothing's gonna stop us now!
Glub glub glub, here we go
Underwater, wow wow wow!

[VERSE 2]
First they tried some leaves so green
Tied together with some vine
Down they went with a glub glub splash!
Soaking wet, but doing fine!
Next they tried some bark so brown
But it leaked and let them down!
"Don't give up!" Papa said with cheer
"Every failure makes the next one clear!"

[CHORUS]
Dive, dive, dive again!
Silly Squirrels submarine crew!
Build it up, splash it down
Try until our dreams come true!
Dive, dive, dive again!
Nothing's gonna stop us now!
Glub glub glub, here we go
Underwater, wow wow wow!

[VERSE 3]
Acorn shells worked so much better
Three small subs in a fleet
Individual submarines
Made their adventure complete!
Pine cone shells were even better
Engineering, oh so neat!
Getting closer to their goal
Adventure feeding every soul!

[BRIDGE]
Mama, Papa, Nutty too
Working together, me and you
Every failure taught them more
Better than the one before
Family teamwork, that's the key
To submarine victory!
Learning, building, trying again
That's the way of submarine friends!

[VERSE 4]
Submarine Number Five was the best
Combined the lessons from all the rest
Down, down, down to the deepest place
Golden light upon their face!
Found the acorn, made their wish
Adventure sealed with a family kiss!
Dreams come true when you never quit
Persistence is the perfect fit!

[FINAL CHORUS]
Dive, dive, dive again!
Silly Squirrels submarine crew!
Never give up, dreams come true
When you work together too!
Dive, dive, dive again!
Adventure never ends, my friend!
Glub glub glub, here we go
With our underwater friends!

(Repeat last two lines with excitement)
Glub glub glub, here we go
With our underwater friends!
SPLASH!
