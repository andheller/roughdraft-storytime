# The Acorn Shell Success

"I've been thinking all night," Nutty announced the next morning, his fur sticking up in excited tufts. "And I think I know what we've been doing wrong!"

Papa looked up from his morning nut-paper. "What's that, son?"

"We've been thinking too **big!**" Nutty spread his paws wide. "Submarines don't have to be squirrel-sized. What if we think... acorn-sized?"

Mama tilted her head thoughtfully. "Go on..."

"Remember Papa's collection of giant acorn shells from the old oak tree? What if we use those as our submarine base? They're naturally waterproof, they're the perfect submarine shape, and..." Nutty paused dramatically, "nature already tested them in rainstorms!"

Papa's eyes lit up. "Nutty, that's genius! Those shells are practically indestructible. And I've got three perfectly matched ones from that big windstorm last month!"

In Papa's workshop, the family examined the three enormous acorn shells. They were each about the size of a soup bowl - perfect for one squirrel each.

"Individual submarines!" Mama exclaimed. "Like a whole submarine fleet!"

"We can call ourselves the Acorn Navy!" Nutty added, already imagining himself as Admiral Nutty.

They spent the morning carefully preparing their acorn shells. Papa drilled small holes for periscopes (using hollow reeds from the pond). Mama lined the insides with soft moss for comfort. Nutty worked on the propulsion system - small paddle wheels made from twigs and leaves that they could spin with their paws.

"Now for the diving mechanism," Papa said, showing off a collection of small pebbles tied to strings. "We can let these down as anchors to control our depth, and pull them back up when we want to surface!"

---

By afternoon, they had three beautiful acorn submarines bobbing in the shallow part of the river. Each one looked like a tiny, adorable submarine with a reed periscope sticking up and small paddle wheels on the sides.

"Test dive, everyone!" Nutty called out, climbing into his acorn shell. It fit perfectly - snug but not cramped like the bark submarine.

"Communication check!" Papa said into his reed periscope. His voice traveled clearly through the hollow reed to the surface. "Admiral Papa to Admiral Nutty, do you copy?"

"Admiral Nutty here, I copy!" Nutty giggled. "Admiral Mama, how do you read?"

"Admiral Mama reads you loud and clear!" came the reply. "All systems go for Operation Golden Acorn!"

They lowered their pebble anchors and began to descend. Unlike their previous attempts, this time everything worked **perfectly**. The acorn shells were completely watertight, they descended at just the right speed, and they could actually steer using their tiny paddle wheels!

"This is incredible!" Nutty called through his periscope. "I can see the river bottom! There are fish everywhere! And look - there's a family of water beetles!"

For twenty wonderful minutes, the three squirrels explored the underwater world in their acorn submarines. They saw dancing water weeds, curious minnows who waved from the windows of "The Leaf Loft" (which now had a mailbox), and even a wise old crayfish who waved at them with his claws.

"We're actually doing it!" Mama laughed, spinning her paddle wheels to do a little underwater loop. "We're real submarine explorers!"

A familiar grumpy face appeared outside Nutty's acorn submarine window. Gerald was swimming alongside them, trying very hard to look unimpressed.

"I'm not following you," Gerald said immediately. "I just happen to be swimming in this direction. For unrelated reasons."

"Are you curious about our submarines?" Nutty asked, grinning.

"Absolutely not. I'm conducting routine river patrol. Which I definitely do every day and not just today."

"You want to see if we find the Golden Acorn, don't you?"

"I want to see you NOT find the Golden Acorn so I can say 'I told you so,'" Gerald corrected. "There's a difference. It's called 'scientific observation of inevitable failure.'"

"That's not a real thing," Papa called from his acorn submarine.

"It is now. I just invented it."

Papa navigated between some underwater rocks, feeling very professional. "I can see why submarines are shaped like this. The acorn design cuts through the water like... well, like a nut through air!"

But as they explored deeper into the river, they realized they had a new problem. The Golden Acorn was supposed to be in the **deepest** part of the river, but their pebble-anchor system could only take them down so far before they had to surface for air.

"We're good," Nutty panted as they finally surfaced, "but we're not **that** good yet. The deep part of the river is still way down there!"

---

Back on shore, the three squirrels sat proudly next to their successful acorn submarines.

"You know what?" Papa said, admiring their handiwork. "This was our first **real** submarine success! We stayed underwater, we steered around, we had fun, and nobody had to make an emergency exit!"

"And we learned something important," Mama added. "The design is right, but we need to think about how to go deeper and stay down longer."

Nutty was already sketching ideas in the sand with a stick. "What if we made the acorn shells bigger? Or connected them together? Or..." his eyes sparkled with inspiration, "what if we found an even **bigger** natural submarine shape?"

"Tomorrow is Submarine Number Four!" Papa declared. "And I have a feeling it's going to be our best one yet!"

As they prepared to carry their acorn submarines home (they were too proud of them to leave them at the river), Gerald surfaced nearby.

"So," he said, trying to sound casual and failing completely, "you're coming back tomorrow, right? Not that I care. Just... river patrol scheduling purposes."

"We'll be back," Nutty promised.

"Whatever. I'll probably be busy." Gerald paused. "What time, exactly?"

"Dawn!"

"I'll be busy at dawn. Definitely. Doing other things." He sank beneath the surface, then immediately popped back up. "But if I HAPPEN to be in the area..."

"We'd love to have you watch us succeed!" Mama said cheerfully.

"Watch you FAIL," Gerald corrected automatically. "Watch you fail. That's what I said."

As they carried their acorn submarines home, Nutty couldn't stop grinning.

"We're really getting the hang of this submarine business," he said happily. "The Golden Acorn better be ready for us!"

"And I think Gerald secretly wants us to find it," Mama added.

"Impossible," Papa laughed. "That catfish is too grumpy to want anything nice to happen."

But Nutty wasn't so sure. He'd seen the look in Gerald's eyes when they talked about the Deep Canyon. It was the look of someone who WANTED to believe, even if he wouldn't admit it.

"Ready or not," Mama laughed, "here come the Silly Squirrels!"
