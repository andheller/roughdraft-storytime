# Houston, We Have a Problem (Also Several Explosions)

**LAUNCH ATTEMPT #1**

**BOOM!**

The trashcan rocket shot off the ground and immediately went SIDEWAYS.

Not up. SIDEWAYS.

"AAAAAHHH!" screamed the squirrels.

**CRASH!**

The rocket smashed straight through the Mayor's brand new gazebo and stopped in his rose bushes.

The Mayor poked his head out his window. "MY GAZEBO!"

"Sorry!" Papa called out, pulling roses from his ears. "Technical difficulties!"

"You owe me a gazebo!"

"Put it on my tab!"

**LAUNCH ATTEMPT #2**

"More TNT this time!" Papa announced.

"Maybe LESS TNT?" Mama suggested.

"That makes no sense!"

**BOOM!**

The rocket went up! Sort of. It also went in CIRCLES.

Round and round and round and round.

"WHEEEEE!" shouted Nutty.

"I'M GONNA BE SICK!" shouted Mama.

"THIS IS AMAZING!" shouted Papa.

**WHAM!**

The spinning rocket slammed into the town water tower. Water exploded everywhere. The squirrels tumbled out, soggy and dizzy.

"We almost had it," Papa said, walking in circles because he couldn't walk straight anymore.

**LAUNCH ATTEMPT #3**

"Okay," Papa said. "I've made IMPROVEMENTS."

The improvements were: more duct tape, more TNT, and a lucky acorn glued to the nose cone.

"Third time's the charm!" Nutty cheered.

**BOOM!**

The rocket went UP!

"YES!"

Five feet... six feet... seven feet... eight feet... nine feet... TEN FEET!

"WE'RE GOING TO SPACE!" Nutty screamed.

**WHAM!**

The rocket stopped going up and went directly into the big oak tree next to their house.

The squirrels tumbled through branches, bounced off limbs, and landed in a pile at the bottom, covered in leaves, soot, and sticky tree sap.

Mama spat out a twig. "Ten feet."

"A new RECORD!" Papa cheered.

"We need MORE TNT," Nutty said.

"We need LESS TNT," Mama said.

"We need..." Papa looked around. "A BIGGER TRASHCAN!"

Somewhere in Nutville, the Mayor was still crying about his gazebo.
