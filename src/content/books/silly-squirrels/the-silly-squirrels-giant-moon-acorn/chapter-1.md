# That's No Moon... Wait, Yes It Is, But Also AN ACORN!

It was a beautiful night in Nutville.

The stars twinkled. The crickets chirped. And Nutty lay on his back in the grass, staring up at the sky.

Then he saw it.

Big. Round. Glowing.

THE BIGGEST ACORN HE HAD EVER SEEN.

"MAMA! PAPA!" Nutty screamed, running inside. "THERE'S A GIANT ACORN IN THE SKY!"

Mama looked out the window. "Sweetie, that's the moon."

"It's SHAPED like an acorn!"

"It's shaped like a circle."

"A CIRCLE ACORN!"

Papa stroked his chin thoughtfully. "You know... it IS kind of acorn-colored..."

"It's WHITE," Mama said.

"White like a... a WHITE acorn!"

Mama sighed. This was going to be a long night.

Ten minutes later, the whole family stood outside, arguing.

"It's definitely an acorn," Nutty insisted. "The biggest one EVER. We should go EAT it!"

"It's definitely the moon," Mama said. "And we can't eat the moon."

"But what if it IS an acorn?" Papa asked. "We'd never know unless we CHECK."

"And how do you plan to check?"

Papa grinned. "Simple! We build a ROCKET!"

He pointed to the garage, where an old trashcan sat next to a dented traffic cone.

"I have EVERYTHING we need!"

---

An hour later, the rocket was complete.

It was a trashcan.

With a traffic cone duct-taped to the top.

With seventeen sticks of TNT strapped to the bottom.

"This," Papa declared proudly, "is the SS MOON MUNCHER!"

"It's a trashcan," Mama said.

"A trashcan OF DESTINY!"

"It's going to explode."

"GLORIOUSLY!"

Nutty was already climbing inside. "Let's GO! That acorn isn't going to eat itself!"

Mama sighed and climbed in after him. If they were going to explode, at least they'd explode as a family.

Papa lit the fuse.

**FSSSSSSSS...**

"This is DEFINITELY going to work," Nutty said.

(It was not going to work.)
