# The Moon Can Wait (But Breakfast Can't)

**LAUNCH ATTEMPT #4: THE BIG ONE**

Papa had outdone himself.

Three trashcans. Duct-taped together. With traffic cones on top of EACH ONE.

And TNT?

ALL of it.

Every single stick of TNT they had was strapped to this magnificent disaster.

"This is the greatest rocket ever built," Papa whispered, wiping a tear from his eye.

"This is three trashcans with traffic cones," Mama said.

"Three trashcans WITH DREAMS!"

Nutty bounced up and down. "Giant moon acorn, here we COME!"

They squeezed inside. It was very cramped. Someone's elbow was in someone's ear. A tail was in someone's face.

Papa lit the fuse.

**FSSSSSSSSS...**

"I just want you both to know," Mama said, "that I love you. Even though you're ridiculous."

"Love you too, Mama!" Nutty said.

"BLAST OFF!" Papa screamed.

**BOOOOOOOOM!!!**

---

The rocket went UP.

Ten feet.

Then it went SIDEWAYS.

Fifty feet.

Then it went DIAGONAL.

Then it started SPINNING.

"NOT AGAIN!" Mama yelled.

**WHAM!**

The rocket smashed through the window of their own house.

**CRASH!**

Through the living room.

**BANG!**

Through the hallway.

**WHAM!**

And finally stopped... in the kitchen.

The three squirrels tumbled out, covered in soot, leaves, glass, and what might have been curtains. They lay flat on the kitchen floor, staring at the ceiling.

"That was fun," Nutty said. "Can we go again?"

"No," said Mama.

"Absolutely," said Papa.

Then Nutty smelled something.

Something wonderful.

He sat up.

Right there, on the kitchen table, was a plate of golden, fluffy pancakes.

A note sat next to them:

*"Left you breakfast! Thought you might need it after your big adventure! Love, Grandma Nutwobble"*

Nutty stared at the pancakes.

They were round.

They were golden.

They looked like...

"Mama. Papa." Nutty pointed slowly. "The MOON. It's not an acorn."

"No?"

"It's a PANCAKE."

Everyone stared at the pancakes. Then at the moon outside the broken window. Then at the pancakes.

"You know what?" Papa said slowly. "That makes total sense."

"It really doesn't," Mama sighed.

"Tomorrow," Nutty declared, shoving a bite of pancake in his mouth, "we're going to eat the MOON PANCAKE!"

"How about," Mama suggested, "we just eat THESE pancakes?"

And so they did.

The moon would have to wait.

But breakfast could not.

**THE END**

*(Don't worry—the moon is still there. And Nutty is STILL planning to eat it.)*
