# Chapter 4: Submarine Surprises

After their spectacular success with rocket-powered transportation (and the less spectacular but equally educational rocket-powered landscaping of Mrs. Oakley's garden), Nutty announced their next venture while Papa was still picking rose petals out of his fur.

"Today," he said, bouncing on his toes with excitement, "we're going underwater!"

"Underwater?" Mama asked, pausing in her high-speed cleanup of rocket debris. "Like... swimming underwater?"

"No! Well, yes, but NO!" Nutty waved his hands frantically. "Not just swimming! We're going to build a SUBMARINE!"

Papa looked up from his rose-petal removal project. "A submarine. You know, those things that go underwater on purpose instead of by accident?"

"Exactly! And get this – submarines work on the same principle as our rockets, except instead of using steam to push them through the air, we use steam to help them dive and surface!"

"Wait," Mama said, hanging upside down from the ceiling beam in the thinking position. "How does steam help something go underwater? Wouldn't steam make it want to float up?"

"EXCELLENT question!" Nutty flipped through his notebook excitedly. "See, submarines work using something called buoyancy. They have special tanks that can be filled with water to make them heavier, or filled with air to make them lighter!"

"So it's like swimming," Papa said slowly. "If I hold a heavy rock, I sink. If I hold a balloon, I float."

"EXACTLY! And we can use steam power to pump water in and out of those tanks really quickly!"

"But where are we going to test this thing?" Mama asked practically. "The creek isn't exactly submarine-sized."

"Acorn Lake!" Nutty announced. "It's perfect! Deep enough for diving, but not so deep that we'll get lost forever!"

Which is how, three hours later, the Nutwobble family found themselves standing on the shore of Acorn Lake with what appeared to be a metal barrel with a window stuck in the front and a small chimney poking out the top.

"It looks like a very confused teapot," Papa observed.

"It's NOT a teapot!" Nutty protested. "It's a highly sophisticated underwater exploration vehicle!"

"With a propeller on the back," Mama added, pointing to the spinning mechanism they'd attached. "That's powered by our steam engine, right?"

"Right! Steam turns the propeller, propeller pushes water backward, submarine moves forward. Just like our rockets, but wetter!"

They had spent the morning carefully waterproofing everything with a paste that Mr. Beaver had recommended. The submarine looked like someone had taken a regular barrel and decided it needed to be prepared for the apocalypse.

"First test," Nutty announced, "we see if it floats."

They carefully lowered their submarine into the shallow water near the shore. It bobbed gently on the surface, with the conning tower sticking up exactly like it was supposed to.

"It's floating!" Mama exclaimed. "It's actually floating and not sinking immediately!"

"Phase one successful," Nutty said, making notes. "Now let's see if we can make it dive."

He activated the steam pump from a control panel they'd set up on the dock. The pump began forcing water into the ballast tanks, and slowly, majestically, the submarine began to sink.

"It's working!" Papa cheered. "Our submarine is actually submerging! This is way better than when I accidentally fall in the creek!"

The submarine descended until just the tip of the conning tower was visible above the water. Nutty carefully adjusted the controls to keep it at that level.

"Perfect neutral buoyancy," he announced proudly. "Now let's test the propulsion."

He fired up the steam engine, and they watched in amazement as the submarine began to move through the water, leaving a trail of bubbles behind it like a very determined underwater train.

"It's like a fish!" Mama marveled. "A mechanical fish that probably doesn't know how to swim!"

"Can we make it come back up?" Papa asked.

"Watch this!" Nutty operated the steam pump in reverse, pushing water out of the ballast tanks and replacing it with air. The submarine began to rise, and soon it was floating on the surface again.

"INCREDIBLE!" Papa exclaimed. "We built a real submarine! And it didn't explode even once!"

"But the real test," Nutty said with a grin that meant he was about to do something that would probably give his parents gray fur, "is whether it works with passengers."

Before his parents could object, Nutty had climbed into the submarine through the small hatch on top. "I'm going to take it for a short underwater cruise!"

"Are you sure that's safe?" Mama called out, now hanging upside down from a nearby tree branch because anxiety made her want to be high up.

"I've got plenty of air inside, and you're holding the safety rope! If anything goes wrong, just yank me back to shore!"

"Like a very expensive fishing lure," Papa muttered.

With that reassuring thought, Nutty closed the hatch and activated the diving system. Mama and Papa watched nervously as their son disappeared beneath the surface of Acorn Lake.

Inside the submarine, Nutty was absolutely blown away by what he could see through the porthole. Fish swam curiously around his vessel, probably wondering what kind of weird new fish had metal skin and made chugging noises.

"This is INCREDIBLE!" he called up to his parents through the speaking tube they'd installed. "I can see everything! There are fish everywhere, and they look just as confused as we are!"

He experimented with the controls, making the submarine rise and dive gently. The steam engine provided smooth, quiet power, and the whole experience was like being inside a magical underwater bubble that might or might not explode.

"I'm going to explore near that old sunken log," Nutty announced. "Maybe there are interesting fish hiding there!"

As he maneuvered the submarine deeper into the lake, he discovered something completely unexpected. Near the bottom of the lake, half-buried in the mud, was what looked like another old machine.

"MAMA! PAPA!" he called excitedly. "You are NOT going to believe what I found down here!"

He carefully piloted the submarine back to the surface, where his parents were waiting with the kind of anxiety that comes from watching your child disappear underwater in a homemade metal tube.

"What did you find?" Mama asked as Nutty climbed out of the submarine, dripping wet and grinning like he'd discovered treasure.

"There's another old machine down there! It looks like it might be some kind of underwater steam engine!"

Papa's eyes widened. "You mean we're not the first squirrels to think of using steam power underwater?"

"Maybe not! And get this – it's HUGE! Like, way bigger than anything we've built!"

They spent the rest of the day making diving expeditions to examine the mysterious underwater machine. With the help of Mrs. Beaver (who, it turned out, was an excellent swimmer and was delighted to help with their latest project), they discovered that the machine was an old steam-powered dredge.

"It was used to dig channels in the lake bottom," Mrs. Beaver explained, "back when they built the mill. My grandmother used to tell stories about it."

"And it's still down there?" Mama asked.

"Still down there, still mostly intact, and probably still functional if someone took the time to fix it up," Mrs. Beaver confirmed.

Nutty's eyes lit up with the kind of dangerous enthusiasm that meant the family was about to undertake another major project. "We could restore it! Think about it – we could use it to clean up the lake bottom, create better swimming areas for the fish, maybe even build underwater channels for... for..."

"For underwater racing?" Papa suggested hopefully.

"For underwater racing!" Nutty agreed. "We could have submarine races!"

"Or underwater acorn delivery!" Mama added, getting caught up in the excitement.

"Or underwater comedy shows!" Papa said. "Think of the acoustics!"

As they packed up their submarine equipment, all three squirrels were buzzing with excitement about their underwater discovery. They had successfully built a working submarine, explored the depths of Acorn Lake, and found a new project that would probably keep them busy for months.

"You know," Papa said as they headed home, "I think we're really making waves with all these steam-powered inventions!"

"Papa," Mama groaned, "that pun was so bad it should stay underwater."

"But it was deep, wasn't it?" Papa continued, completely unrepentant.

"Tomorrow," Nutty announced, interrupting his parents' ongoing pun war, "we're going to figure out how to restore that dredge. And maybe build a bigger submarine. And possibly invent underwater sandwiches."

"Underwater sandwiches?" Mama asked.

"Well, all this swimming is making me hungry," Nutty explained. "And if we're going to be spending a lot of time underwater, we need to think about the practical things. Like snacks."

"That," Papa said with approval, "is the most sensible thing anyone has said all day."

And as they walked home through the evening mist, the three squirrels were already planning their next underwater adventure, completely unaware that their steam-powered projects were about to attract the attention of the entire town.

But that's a story for tomorrow.

Tonight, they were just a family of squirrels who had successfully built a submarine and discovered that the lake was full of surprises.

And really, what more could you ask for?
