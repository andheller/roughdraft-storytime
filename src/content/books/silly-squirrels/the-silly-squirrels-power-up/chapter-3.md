# Chapter 3: Rocket-Powered Chaos

About a week after The Great Steam Engine Experiment (which had resulted in a perfectly working steam engine and only minor eyebrow singeing), Nutty made a discovery that would change everything.

"FAMILY MEETING!" he shouted, bursting into the kitchen where Mama was doing dishes at approximately the speed of light and Papa was methodically working through what appeared to be his seventh breakfast acorn.

"Is the steam engine broken?" Mama asked, instantly appearing upside down from the ceiling again.

"No! Better! I found something in the manual that's going to blow your minds!" Nutty waved the book around like it was on fire, which, considering their recent track record with steam-powered devices, was a legitimate concern.

"Please tell me it's not actually going to blow our minds," Papa said hopefully. "I've grown quite attached to my mind. It's where I keep all my acorn-related thoughts."

"It's not LITERALLY going to blow your minds, Papa. But look!" Nutty flipped to a page that showed a diagram of something that looked like a pointed metal tube with steam shooting out the back. "It's called a steam rocket!"

"A ROCKET?" Mama zoomed down from the ceiling so fast she created a small tornado in the kitchen. "Like the kind that goes to the moon?"

"Well, probably not the moon on our first try," Nutty said, trying to sound responsible while his eyes were practically glowing with excitement. "But rockets work on the same principle as our steam engine, except instead of using steam to push pistons, we use steam to push the ENTIRE ROCKET!"

Papa looked at the diagram with deep suspicion. "Are you telling me we're going to build a metal tube, fill it with angry water, and then... ride it?"

"Eventually, maybe! But first we start small. See, when steam rushes out of the back of the rocket super fast, it pushes the rocket forward just as hard. It's called thrust!"

"Thrust," Papa repeated slowly. "That sounds like a word that ends with someone getting launched into a tree."

"It's Newton's Third Law of Motion!" Nutty said, getting that squeaky-excited voice again. "For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction!"

To demonstrate, he grabbed a balloon from their party supplies (because apparently every squirrel family keeps balloon supplies on hand for impromptu science demonstrations) and blew it up.

"Watch this!" He let go of the balloon, and it went FLYING around the kitchen, bouncing off walls and making that ridiculous balloon noise before finally landing in Papa's acorn bowl.

"The air pushes out one way," Nutty explained as Papa fished the balloon out of his breakfast, "and the balloon gets pushed the opposite way! That's thrust!"

"So a rocket is like a balloon filled with steam instead of air?" Mama asked.

"Exactly! But much more controlled and hopefully less likely to end up in someone's breakfast."

Papa's eyes lit up with the kind of dangerous enthusiasm that usually preceded family disasters. "You mean we could build a rocket that actually flies through the air?"

"Let's start with a tiny one," Nutty said wisely, "and see what happens."

What happened was three squirrels spending the morning running around Nutville collecting rocket-building supplies like they were preparing for the apocalypse. They needed a small metal tube, something to seal one end, and a nozzle for the steam to escape from.

"What about that old soup can?" Mama suggested, holding up a dented tin can that looked like it had seen better decades.

"And I saw some small metal pipes at Mr. Beaver's shop," Papa added. "We could use one of those for the nozzle!"

"Perfect! We'll also need our camp stove to heat the water inside the rocket," Nutty said, making notes in his notebook with the kind of intensity usually reserved for military strategy planning.

After another trip to see Mr. Beaver (who was definitely starting to think the Nutwobbles were either building something amazing or planning to accidentally level the town), they had everything they needed.

"First," Nutty announced, "we seal one end of the can. That's the nose of our rocket."

Papa carefully hammered a metal plate over one end of the can, creating what looked like a very angry soup can with a flat face.

"Now we attach the nozzle to the other end," Nutty continued. "The steam will shoot out through here and push the rocket forward."

Mama held the pipe steady while Nutty attached it to the back of the can. "How do we get water inside this thing?"

"We'll add water through a small hole in the side, then seal it up with a cork," Nutty explained. "When we heat the rocket, the water inside will turn to steam and shoot out the nozzle like... like..."

"Like a very angry tea kettle?" Papa suggested.

"Exactly! But with more flying!"

They worked all afternoon, carefully assembling their first steam rocket. When they were finished, they had a small, pointed metal cylinder that looked like it was ready to either fly to the moon or explode spectacularly.

"It looks like a tiny metal acorn with a very long tail," Papa observed.

"Now for the moment of truth," Nutty said dramatically. "We need to test it safely, where it has room to move and won't accidentally demolish anything important."

They placed the rocket on a small wheeled cart and pointed it toward the big empty field behind the mill. Nutty carefully poured water into the rocket through the side hole, then sealed it with a cork.

"Everyone stand back!" he called, lighting the camp stove underneath the rocket. "We don't know exactly how fast this thing will go!"

They watched nervously as the rocket heated up. For a few minutes, nothing happened except the usual sounds of water heating up.

"Is it supposed to take this long?" Papa asked.

"Maybe we didn't use enough water?" Mama wondered.

"Or maybe we used too much water?" Nutty worried.

Then they heard it – a faint hissing sound.

"Steam!" Mama whispered.

The hissing grew louder, and suddenly – WHOOOOOOSH! – a jet of steam shot out the back of the rocket like a tiny white dragon.

The rocket shot forward on its cart, racing across the field faster than Mama could run, which was saying something because Mama could run fast enough to make roadrunners jealous.

"IT WORKS!" Papa shouted, jumping up and down. "IT ACTUALLY WORKS!"

The rocket traveled almost a hundred feet before the steam ran out and it rolled to a stop in the middle of the field. All three squirrels ran after it, their tails bristling with excitement.

"That was INCREDIBLE!" Mama exclaimed. "It went so fast I could barely see it!"

"Did you see how the steam came out in one continuous jet?" Nutty asked, making frantic notes in his notebook. "That's what gave us steady thrust!"

"So the faster the steam comes out, the faster the rocket goes?" Papa asked.

"Exactly! And the longer we can keep steam coming out, the farther it will travel!"

They spent the rest of the afternoon experimenting with their rocket like mad scientists with unlimited enthusiasm and only basic safety protocols. They tried different amounts of water, different levels of heat, and different nozzle positions.

"A bigger nozzle lets more steam out at once," Nutty observed after one particularly spectacular launch, "but it doesn't last as long. A smaller nozzle makes the steam last longer but doesn't create as much thrust."

"It's all about finding the right balance," Mama realized. "Like everything else with steam power."

As the sun started to set, they were feeling pretty confident about their rocket-building skills. Which, in retrospect, was probably a mistake.

"You know what?" Papa said with a grin that should have been accompanied by warning sirens, "I think we're ready to build a bigger rocket. Maybe one big enough to actually ride!"

"Let's perfect the small ones first," Nutty said sensibly. "We should probably figure out how to control where they go before we start strapping ourselves to them."

"But just imagine," Mama said, her eyes getting that dreamy look that meant she was picturing herself zooming through the air at impossible speeds, "rocket-powered mail delivery! We could be the fastest postal service in the history of squirrels!"

"Or rocket-powered acorn transport!" Papa added. "We could deliver acorns across town in seconds!"

"First," Nutty said, trying to be the voice of reason, "let's see if we can make one that flies straight."

Which turned out to be significantly harder than expected.

The next morning, they built an improved rocket – longer, more pointed, with little metal fins on the back to help it fly straight. It looked like a proper rocket, the kind you'd see in science fiction movies.

"This one will definitely work better," Nutty announced confidently, because he hadn't yet learned that the universe has a sense of humor about confident announcements.

They loaded it with water, heated it up, and launched it with great ceremony.

The rocket immediately veered to the left, then to the right, then spun in a complete circle before crashing directly into Mrs. Oakley's prize-winning rose bushes.

"Well," Papa said after a moment of stunned silence, "that was... different."

"What went wrong?" Nutty asked, racing toward the crashed rocket with his notebook.

"I think the nozzle is crooked," Mama observed, examining the rocket. "Look, it's not pointing exactly straight back."

"So even a tiny mistake in construction can cause big problems in flight," Nutty realized. "Like how a small pebble in your shoe can make you run in circles."

"Exactly!" Papa said. "Except with more explosions and angry neighbors!"

They spent the next hour carefully adjusting the rocket, making sure everything was perfectly aligned. This time, Nutty used a straight edge to ensure the nozzle was pointing in exactly the right direction.

"Attempt number two!" he announced.

This time, the rocket launched perfectly straight – for about twenty feet. Then it suddenly pitched upward, soared high into the air like it was trying to visit the clouds, and came crashing down in the middle of the creek with a tremendous splash.

"Our rocket has decided to become a submarine!" Papa laughed.

"But why did it go up instead of forward?" Mama wondered.

"I think we had too much steam pressure," Nutty said, frantically flipping through his notebook. "When the pressure is too high, the steam comes out so fast that it makes the rocket unstable."

"So we need just the right amount of steam," Mama realized. "Not too little, not too much."

"Right! It's like making the perfect acorn soup – you need just the right amount of everything."

Mama used her super-speed to fish the rocket out of the creek. Fortunately, being made of metal, it had survived its unexpected swim just fine.

"Third time's the charm?" Papa asked hopefully.

"Third time's the charm," Nutty agreed. "But this time, we'll use less heat to create lower pressure."

For their third attempt, Nutty heated the water gradually and monitored the steam pressure like he was defusing a bomb. When they heard the gentle hissing that indicated the perfect amount of steam, he gave the signal.

"Launch!"

This time, the rocket performed beautifully. It shot forward in a perfectly straight line, maintained course for the entire flight, and landed gracefully in the soft grass about 150 feet away.

"SUCCESS!" all three squirrels cheered.

"Now THAT," Papa said with satisfaction, "was a textbook rocket launch! If there were textbooks about rocket-launching squirrels, which there probably should be."

"I want to try different fin designs next," Nutty said, already planning their next experiment. "Maybe we can make one that carries a payload – like a message or a small package."

"Or a really tiny acorn!" Mama suggested.

"Or a really tiny joke!" Papa added. "The world's first rocket-powered comedy delivery service!"

As they packed up their equipment, Nutty reflected on their day of trial and error. "You know what I learned today? Even when things go wrong, we can figure out why and fix them. Every failure teaches us something new."

"And working together makes even the crashes fun," Mama added.

"Plus," Papa concluded, "we now have the most interesting lawn ornament in Nutville – a rocket-crashed rose bush!"

The three squirrels headed home as the stars began to appear, their minds already racing with possibilities for their next steam-powered adventure.

"Tomorrow," Nutty announced, "we're going underwater!"

"Underwater?" Papa's tail perked up. "Like... submarine underwater?"

"Exactly like submarine underwater! But with steam power!"

"I can't wait to see what kind of disasters we'll have underwater," Papa chuckled.

"They won't be disasters," Mama corrected. "They'll be learning experiences!"

"With bubbles!" Nutty added excitedly.

And with that delightful thought, the three squirrels scampered home through the evening mist, completely unaware that their underwater adventures would be even more chaotic than their rocket experiments.

But that's what made them adventures.
