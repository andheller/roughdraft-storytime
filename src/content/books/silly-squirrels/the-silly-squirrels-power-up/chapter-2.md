# Chapter 2: Steam Engine Shenanigans

Nutty woke up at approximately the crack of dawn, which was annoying because it was Saturday and he usually liked to sleep until at least the crack of mid-morning. But his brain was doing that thing where it gets SO excited about something that it forgets sleep is supposed to be enjoyable.

"WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!" he shouted, bouncing on his parents' bed like a caffeinated ping-pong ball. "I figured out how to make water angry!"

Papa Nutwobble's head popped up from under his leaf blanket, one eye still closed. "Did you say angry water? Because I've seen angry water. It's called rain, and it's terrible."

"No, Papa! Not angry like grumpy! Angry like... like EXPLOSIVE!"

That got both his parents' attention pretty quickly. Mama Nutwobble was suddenly wide awake and hanging upside down from the ceiling beam, because that's where she always went when she was either very excited or very worried, and sometimes it was hard to tell which.

"Explosive water?" she squeaked. "Should we be concerned? Because I feel like we should be concerned."

"It's GOOD explosive!" Nutty said, waving the steam engine manual around like a flag. "Look! I stayed up all night reading this thing, and I drew pictures, and I think I understand how steam works!"

Papa Nutwobble looked at the notebook full of wobbly diagrams and numbers. "Nutty, this looks like someone sneezed on a math book."

"Those are SCIENTIFIC DIAGRAMS, Papa!"

"Oh. Well, that explains the sneezing."

Mama Nutwobble dropped down from the ceiling and started zipping around the room, tidying up at super-speed while somehow also making breakfast. "Okay, explain this explosive water situation before my tail falls off from anxiety."

"First," Nutty announced dramatically, "I need to show you something AMAZING about water."

He grabbed an acorn cap and filled it with water from their rain barrel. "This is just regular, boring water, right? The kind that sits there being all wet and liquid-y and not doing anything interesting."

"Right..." Papa said slowly, like he was talking to someone who might suddenly start speaking in tongues.

"But WATCH!" Nutty held the acorn cap over the fireplace, where Mama had already started a fire because she was apparently part squirrel, part tornado, and part magic. "When you heat water up, it doesn't just get hot. It gets ANGRY!"

The water started bubbling, and Papa Nutwobble's eyes went wide. "It's... it's moving!"

"It's not just moving, Papa! It's expanding! See, all the tiny water bits – they're called molecules, which is a fancy word for 'really small things that make up everything' – they start bouncing around like they've had way too much coffee!"

Mama Nutwobble watched the water disappearing into invisible steam. "Where did it go? Did it just... vanish?"

"It didn't vanish!" Nutty said, practically vibrating with excitement. "It turned into steam! And here's the REALLY cool part – steam takes up about 1,600 times more space than the same amount of water!"

"1,600 times?" Papa's tail puffed up. "That's like... that's like..."

"Like if you ate one acorn but then your stomach thought you'd eaten 1,600 acorns!" Nutty said helpfully.

"That would be a very confused stomach," Papa observed.

"And a very big stomach," Mama added.

"EXACTLY!" Nutty pulled out a small glass jar. "Now watch this!"

He put a tiny bit of water in the jar and heated it up. As the water turned to steam, the jar filled with white vapor, and you could almost see the steam pushing against the glass.

"See how the steam is trying to get out?" Nutty pointed excitedly. "That's pressure! The steam is pushing against everything around it, trying to find more room to expand!"

"So it's like when I eat too much and my pants get tight?" Papa asked.

"Kind of! Except instead of tight pants, we can use that pushing force to move things! Like... like..." Nutty grabbed his drawings and started flipping through them frantically. "Like pistons! And wheels! And maybe even rockets if we're feeling particularly ambitious!"

Mama Nutwobble was studying the steam engine manual over his shoulder. "So you're telling me that we can make that big rusty machine work just by making water really, really angry?"

"Basically, yes!" Nutty beamed. "You heat water in this part called a boiler, and the water turns into steam, and the steam gets all excited and pushes this thing called a piston, and the piston is connected to a rod, and the rod turns the wheels!"

"It's like a chain reaction of anger!" Papa said, getting excited now too.

"And the best part is, after the steam does its job, it turns back into water! So you can use the same water over and over again! It's like... like having a pet that never gets tired!"

"A pet that could explode if you're not careful," Mama pointed out helpfully.

"Well, yes, there's that," Nutty admitted. "But look!" He flipped to a page covered in safety diagrams. "The manual has ALL these safety things! There are gauges that tell you how much pressure you have, and special valves that let steam out if there's too much, and even a whistle that goes TOOT TOOT!"

"Can we make it go TOOT TOOT right now?" Papa asked hopefully.

"We have to fix it first!" Nutty said. "And that's going to be... interesting."

So they all trooped back to the old mill, where their steam engine was waiting patiently under its blanket of rust and ancient spider webs. In the morning light, it looked even more magnificent and also significantly more broken than they'd remembered.

"Okay," Nutty said, pulling out his notebook. "According to the manual, first we need to check if all the parts are there."

"What parts?" Mama asked.

"Um..." Nutty consulted his notes. "The boiler, the firebox, the pistons, the rods, the wheels, the pressure gauge, the safety valve, the whistle, and... oh." He looked up at the engine. "About a million other things that I can't pronounce."

Papa Nutwobble was already crawling around the engine, poking at things. "Well, there's definitely a big round thing that looks like it used to hold water, and some pipe-y things, and... OH!" He stuck his head up from behind the engine. "I found the wheels! They're still attached and everything!"

"Are they round?" Mama asked, zipping over to look.

"Mostly! I mean, they're a little... rusty. And one of them is kind of more oval than round. But they spin!" He gave one of the wheels a push, and it moved with a grinding sound that suggested it hadn't spun in about fifty years.

"That's... good?" Nutty said hopefully.

Mama Nutwobble was examining the boiler. "This big tank thing has a hole in it."

"A hole?" Nutty scrambled over to look. "How big of a hole?"

"Well, it's not huge, but it's definitely hole-shaped. And holes are generally not supposed to be in things that hold water under pressure."

"Can we fix it?" Papa asked.

"I don't know," Nutty said honestly. "Let me check the manual." He flipped through pages frantically. "Okay, okay, here we go... 'Common repairs and maintenance'... 'Replacing worn gaskets'... 'Dealing with minor leaks'... OH! 'Patching small holes in the boiler'!"

"It talks about holes?" Mama asked hopefully.

"It does! It says you can patch small holes with... um..." Nutty squinted at the page. "With metal patches and some kind of really strong glue called sealant?"

"Do we have really strong glue?" Papa asked.

"Do we have metal patches?" Mama asked.

"Do we have any idea what we're doing?" Nutty asked.

They all looked at each other for a moment.

"Not really," Papa said cheerfully. "But that's never stopped us before!"

"True," Mama agreed. "Remember when we tried to build that tree house and ended up with a very confused bird apartment complex?"

"The birds loved it though," Nutty pointed out.

"And remember when we tried to make our own maple syrup and accidentally invented squirrel glue?"

"We're still finding things stuck to other things from that experiment," Papa said fondly.

"So basically," Nutty said, "we're going to learn about steam engines by trying to fix one, and we're probably going to mess up a lot, but that's okay because that's how you learn things!"

"And if we accidentally blow ourselves up?" Mama asked.

"Then we'll have learned something VERY important about steam pressure!" Nutty said brightly.

"I like this plan," Papa said. "It has just the right amount of potential disaster to be interesting."

And so began what would later be known in the Nutwobble family as "The Great Steam Engine Experiment," or alternatively, "Why We Don't Have Eyebrows Anymore."

But they didn't know that yet. All they knew was that they had a rusty machine, a manual full of words they couldn't pronounce, and enough enthusiasm to power a small city.

What could possibly go wrong?
