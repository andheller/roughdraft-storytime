# Chapter 2: Steam Engine Shenanigans

Nutty woke up at approximately the crack of dawn, which was annoying because it was Saturday and he usually liked to sleep until at least the crack of mid-morning. But his brain was doing that thing where it gets SO excited about something that it forgets sleep is supposed to be enjoyable.

"WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!" he shouted, bouncing on his parents' bed like a caffeinated ping-pong ball. "I figured out how to make water angry!"

Papa Nutwobble's head emerged from under his leaf blanket with an acorn stuck to his cheek and what appeared to be a small twig growing out of his ear. "Did you say angry water? Because I've seen angry water. It's called rain, and it's terrible. Also—" he squinted at the window "—the sun isn't even properly awake yet. Look at it, just sitting there on the horizon like it's not sure if it wants to come to work today."

"No, Papa! Not angry like grumpy! Angry like... like EXPLOSIVE!"

That got both his parents' attention pretty quickly. Mama Nutwobble was suddenly wide awake and hanging upside down from the ceiling beam, except she'd moved so fast she'd accidentally grabbed the wrong beam and was now upside down OUTSIDE the window.

"Explosive water?" she squeaked through the glass. "Should we be concerned? Because I feel like—hang on." She zipped back inside, leaving a mama-shaped hole in a spiderweb and a very confused spider. "Okay, NOW should we be concerned?"

"It's GOOD explosive!" Nutty said, waving the steam engine manual around like a flag. "Look! I stayed up all night reading this thing, and I drew pictures, and I think I understand how steam works!"

Papa Nutwobble squinted at the notebook full of wobbly diagrams and numbers. "Nutty, this looks like someone gave a pencil to a dizzy octopus during an earthquake."

"Those are SCIENTIFIC DIAGRAMS, Papa!"

"Oh. Well, that explains why this one appears to show water screaming."

"That's not screaming, that's EXPANDING!" Nutty said, though looking at it again, he had to admit the wavy lines did look a bit like tiny water screams.

Mama Nutwobble dropped down from the ceiling and started zipping around the room, tidying up at super-speed while somehow also making breakfast, doing laundry, reorganizing the bookshelf alphabetically, and accidentally knitting half a sweater. "Okay, explain this explosive water situation before my tail falls off from anxiety."

"First," Nutty announced dramatically, "I need to show you something AMAZING about water."

He grabbed an acorn cap and filled it with water from their rain barrel. "This is just regular, boring water, right? The kind that sits there being all wet and liquid-y and not doing anything interesting."

"Right..." Papa said slowly, already reaching for an emergency snack acorn from the fourteen he kept hidden in his fur for exactly these kinds of morning surprises.

"But WATCH!" Nutty held the acorn cap over the fireplace, where Mama had already started a fire because she was apparently part squirrel, part tornado, and part magic. "When you heat water up, it doesn't just get hot. It gets ANGRY!"

The water started bubbling, and Papa Nutwobble's eyes went wide. "It's... it's moving! Is it trying to escape? Water, I understand your feelings about mornings, but—"

"It's not just moving, Papa! It's expanding! See, all the tiny water bits – they're called molecules, which is a fancy word for 'really small things that make up everything' – they start bouncing around like they've had seventeen cups of coffee and found out there's a sale on acorns!"

Mama Nutwobble watched the water disappearing into invisible steam. "Where did it go? Did it just... vanish?" She zipped to check behind the fireplace, under the rug, and inside Papa's ear (finding three more snack acorns) before returning. "It's not hiding anywhere!"

"It didn't vanish!" Nutty said, practically vibrating with excitement. "It turned into steam! And here's the REALLY cool part – steam takes up about 1,600 times more space than the same amount of water!"

"1,600 times?" Papa's tail puffed up so dramatically it knocked a painting off the wall. "That's like... that's like..."

"Like if you ate one acorn but then your stomach thought you'd eaten 1,600 acorns!" Nutty said helpfully.

Papa's eyes glazed over with what could only be described as acorn-based religious ecstasy. "That would be... beautiful."

"That would be EXPLODING, dear," Mama corrected.

"Beautiful exploding," Papa whispered dreamily.

"ANYWAY!" Nutty pulled out a small glass jar. "Now watch this!"

He put a tiny bit of water in the jar and heated it up. As the water turned to steam, the jar filled with white vapor, and you could almost see the steam pushing against the glass like it was a tiny prisoner planning a very wet escape.

"See how the steam is trying to get out?" Nutty pointed excitedly. "That's pressure! The steam is pushing against everything around it, trying to find more room to expand!"

"So it's like when I eat too much and my pants get tight?" Papa asked, patting his distinctly round belly.

"KIND of, except—"

"Because that happens a lot," Papa continued seriously. "I've had to let out my pants three times this month."

"It's true," Mama said, zipping past. "I've been using the extra fabric to make tiny flags."

"The POINT is," Nutty said, steering the conversation back on track, "instead of tight pants, we can use that pushing force to move things! Like pistons! And wheels! And maybe even rockets if we're feeling particularly ambitious!"

Mama Nutwobble was studying the steam engine manual over his shoulder, though she was reading it so fast the pages were creating a small breeze. "So you're telling me that we can make that big rusty machine work just by making water really, really angry?"

"Basically, yes!" Nutty beamed. "You heat water in this part called a boiler, and the water turns into steam, and the steam gets all excited and pushes this thing called a piston, and the piston is connected to a rod, and the rod turns the wheels!"

"It's like a chain reaction of anger!" Papa said, getting excited now too. "Like when I accidentally eat the last acorn and then Mama gets mad and then you get mad that Mama's mad and then the neighbor gets mad because we're all yelling and—"

"Less like that," Nutty interrupted quickly.

"And the best part is, after the steam does its job, it turns back into water! So you can use the same water over and over again! It's like having a pet that never gets tired!"

"A pet that could explode if you're not careful," Mama pointed out helpfully.

"Well, yes, there's that," Nutty admitted. "But look!" He flipped to a page covered in safety diagrams. "The manual has ALL these safety things! There are gauges that tell you how much pressure you have, and special valves that let steam out if there's too much, and even a whistle that goes TOOT TOOT!"

"Did you say TOOT TOOT?" Papa asked, suddenly more awake than he'd been in years.

"I said TOOT TOOT!"

"Can we make it go TOOT TOOT right now?" Papa was already halfway to the door.

"We have to fix it first!" Nutty said. "And that's going to be... interesting."

So they all trooped back to the old mill, where their steam engine was waiting patiently under its blanket of rust and ancient spider webs. In the morning light, it looked even more magnificent and also significantly more broken than they'd remembered. Also, there was now a bird's nest in the chimney and what appeared to be a very comfortable mouse apartment in the firebox.

"Excuse me," Nutty said politely to the mice, "but we're going to need to light fires in here."

The mice did not look pleased. One of them held up a tiny sign that said "We were here first."

"We'll build you a nicer house," Mama offered, zipping off and returning 0.3 seconds later with a fully furnished mouse mansion made from an old jewelry box. The mice moved immediately.

"Okay," Nutty said, pulling out his notebook. "According to the manual, first we need to check if all the parts are there."

"What parts?" Mama asked.

"Um..." Nutty consulted his notes. "The boiler, the firebox, the pistons, the rods, the wheels, the pressure gauge, the safety valve, the whistle, and... oh." He looked up at the engine. "About a million other things that I can't pronounce. This one is called the 'reciprocating linkage assembly' and I think this one might be a swear word in engineer language."

Papa Nutwobble was already crawling around the engine, poking at things. "Well, there's definitely a big round thing that looks like it used to hold water, and some pipe-y things, and... OH!" His head popped up from behind the engine wearing a spider as a hat. "I found the wheels! They're still attached and everything!"

"Are they round?" Mama asked, zipping over to look.

"Mostly! I mean, they're a little... rusty. And one of them is kind of more oval than round. And this one—" he gave it a push and it made a sound like a dying goose fighting a rusty gate "—might need some oil."

"That's... good?" Nutty said hopefully.

Mama Nutwobble was examining the boiler. "This big tank thing has a hole in it."

"A hole?" Nutty scrambled over to look. "How big of a hole?"

"Well..." Mama stuck her entire arm through it. "Medium?"

"Holes are generally not supposed to be in things that hold water under pressure," Nutty said, suddenly feeling less confident about this whole operation.

"Can we fix it?" Papa asked, finally noticing the spider on his head and relocating it to a nearby beam with a friendly pat.

"I don't know," Nutty said honestly. "Let me check the manual." He flipped through pages frantically. "Okay, okay, here we go... 'Common repairs and maintenance'... 'Replacing worn gaskets'... 'What to do if your engine becomes sentient'—wait, what?"

"What does THAT one say?" Mama asked nervously.

"'Do not panic. Offer it a nice breakfast and discuss its feelings.' That's... oddly specific." Nutty kept flipping. "'Dealing with minor leaks'... OH! 'Patching small holes in the boiler'!"

"It talks about holes?" Mama asked hopefully.

"It does! It says you can patch small holes with metal patches and some kind of really strong glue called sealant." He looked at the arm-sized hole in the boiler. "Although their definition of 'small' and our definition of 'small' might be having a disagreement."

"Do we have really strong glue?" Papa asked.

"Do we have metal patches?" Mama asked.

"Do we have any idea what we're doing?" Nutty asked.

They all looked at each other for a moment.

"Not even slightly," Papa said cheerfully. "But that's never stopped us before!"

"True," Mama agreed. "Remember when we tried to build that tree house and ended up with a very confused bird apartment complex?"

"The birds loved it though," Nutty pointed out. "They started a neighborhood association."

"And remember when we tried to make our own maple syrup and accidentally invented squirrel glue?"

"We're still finding things stuck to other things from that experiment," Papa said fondly. "I found a spoon attached to a book attached to my hat just last week. I'd been wondering where that spoon went."

"So basically," Nutty said, "we're going to learn about steam engines by trying to fix one, and we're probably going to mess up a lot, but that's okay because that's how you learn things!"

"And if we accidentally blow ourselves up?" Mama asked.

"Then we'll have learned something VERY important about steam pressure!" Nutty said brightly.

"I like this plan," Papa said. "It has just the right amount of potential disaster to be interesting."

---

What followed was three hours of the most educational chaos the Nutwobble family had ever experienced.

First, they patched the hole in the boiler using metal sheets from Mr. Beaver's shop and enough sealant to glue a house to a mountain. The hole looked less like a hole and more like a very enthusiastic metal scab.

Then they cleaned out approximately forty-seven years of rust, fourteen bird nests, one very old sandwich (which Papa tried to eat before being stopped), and what appeared to be a family of beetles who'd been running a small library in the firebox.

"Sorry about your books," Nutty apologized as they relocated the beetles.

The beetles didn't seem too upset. They'd already started a new library in a hollow log nearby, and the old one had been getting too smoky anyway.

By afternoon, the steam engine was starting to look less like an ancient relic and more like an ancient relic that someone had actually tried to clean. Progress!

"I think we're ready for the first test," Nutty announced nervously.

"Should we have safety goggles?" Mama asked.

"We don't have safety goggles."

"Should we stand behind something?"

"That seems wise, yes."

They filled the boiler with water, lit a fire in the firebox, and then retreated behind a large rock to wait. Papa had brought snacks. Mama was vibrating with anticipation so hard she was creating a small dust storm.

For several minutes, nothing happened.

"Is it supposed to—" Papa started.

PSSSSHHHHHHHHHH!

Steam erupted from approximately seventeen places it wasn't supposed to come from, including several holes they hadn't known existed. The pressure gauge spun around like it was trying to win a race. The safety valve made a sound like a very surprised trumpet.

And then, gloriously, magnificently, the whistle went TOOT TOOT!

"IT WORKS!" Papa shouted, jumping up from behind the rock.

Unfortunately, that was also when the patch on the boiler decided it wasn't quite as secure as they'd hoped. A jet of steam shot out sideways and caught Papa directly in the face.

When the steam cleared, Papa was standing there looking like a very surprised cotton ball. His eyebrows were completely gone. His whiskers were curled into tiny spirals. And his expression suggested he'd just had a very meaningful conversation with the concept of surprise itself.

"Papa?" Nutty called out nervously. "Are you okay?"

Papa blinked twice, steam still wafting gently from his ears.

"That," he said slowly, "was the most AMAZING thing that has ever happened to my face."

"Your eyebrows are gone, dear," Mama pointed out.

Papa felt his forehead. "Huh. So they are. Well, they weren't doing anything important anyway. Can we do it again?"

And so began what would later be known in the Nutwobble family as "The Great Steam Engine Experiment," or alternatively, "Why We Don't Have Eyebrows Anymore," or even more alternatively, "That Time Papa Got Face-Steamed And Liked It."

They spent the rest of the day patching patches, tightening things that had gotten loose, and learning exactly which parts of the engine were the "don't stand there" parts. By sunset, the engine was running smoothly, the whistle was tooting on command, and all three squirrels had lost their eyebrows in various steam-related incidents.

"You know," Mama said, examining her reflection in a shiny brass fitting, "I think I look more aerodynamic now."

"I think I look distinguished," Papa said. "Like a very surprised professor."

"I think we all look like we've been surprised by science," Nutty said. "Which, to be fair, we have been."

But they'd done it. They'd fixed a steam engine. They'd learned about pressure and heat and water and the mysterious power of Really Angry Molecules.

And tomorrow, they'd learn about something even more exciting.

Rockets.

But they didn't know that yet. All they knew was that they had a working steam engine, zero eyebrows between them, and the satisfied feeling of a job well done.

What could possibly go wrong?

(Everything. Everything could go wrong. But that's what made it an adventure.)
