# Chapter 4: Grandma's Got Dynamite

The Nutwobble family trudged through Muddy Meadow. Again.

"I've got mud in places I didn't know I had," Papa complained.

"Almost to Grumpy Badger's den," Mama said, her super-speed useless in the thick muck. "Everyone tippy-toe past."

Nutty's tail dragged through the mud behind him. Three days of explosions. Twelve craters. One ancient cave discovery. One complete underground town network. Zero tunnel to Grandma's.

"Maybe we could ask Mrs. Hedgehog if she has any dynamite?" Papa suggested weakly.

"Papa, we can't keep blowing things up," Nutty sighed. "We're out of explosives and out of ideas and—"

**BOOOOM!!!**

A massive explosion echoed through the forest. The ground shook. Birds scattered. Grumpy Badger poked his head out of his den and immediately went back inside.

"What was THAT?!" Mama gasped.

The explosion had come from AHEAD of them. From the direction of...

"GRANDMA'S HOUSE!" they shouted together.

Mama grabbed her family and ZOOMED through the rest of the meadow, over Wobbly Bridge, and toward the smoke rising above the trees. They burst into Grandma's clearing and stopped dead.

There, standing at the edge of a MASSIVE hole, was Grandma Nutwobble.

She was covered head to tail in soot. Her glasses were crooked. Her apron was singed. In one paw, she held a detonator. In the other, a cup of tea (miraculously intact).

Behind her: a stack of empty TNT crates.

"Oh, there you are!" Grandma said cheerfully. "Perfect timing!"

"Grandma!" Nutty gasped. "You... you have DYNAMITE?!"

"HAD dynamite, dear. Just used the last of it." She gestured to the smoking hole. "Your grandfather's 'just in case' collection. I found it in the attic yesterday."

Papa's jaw dropped. "You had dynamite this WHOLE TIME?!"

"Well, yes. But I wanted to see what you three would do first." Grandma's eyes twinkled. "You didn't disappoint! I've been watching from my telescope. The Mr. Mole incident was particularly entertaining."

"GRANDMA!"

"What? I'm old. I need hobbies." She sipped her tea. "But when I saw you'd run out of supplies, I figured it was my turn. Now come look!"

They crept to the edge of the hole. It went down, down, down... and then SIDEWAYS, stretching into darkness toward Nutville.

"I calculated the trajectory based on the tunnel network you created," Grandma explained. "One good blast and—" She snapped her fingers. "Direct connection!"

"But how did you know where our tunnels were?" Nutty asked.

Grandma tapped her head. "I've lived here for sixty years, dear. I know where every old mine shaft runs. Your explosions just... woke them up."

Mama started laughing. Then Papa. Then Nutty. Soon the whole family was doubled over, tears streaming down their furry faces.

"Three days of chaos," Papa wheezed.

"Twelve craters," Mama giggled.

"And Grandma finishes it with ONE explosion," Nutty howled.

Grandma patted Nutty on the head. "You did all the hard work. I just did the finale." She set down her tea. "Now, who wants to test the tunnel?"

---

Twenty minutes later, the Nutwobbles stood in the new Nutville Underground station (formerly their backyard).

The tunnel to Grandma's was lit with little lanterns now. Mr. Mole, surprisingly, had volunteered to be the first "Tunnel Inspector." ("If I'm going to have holes in my ceiling," he'd grumbled, "I might as well make them OFFICIAL holes.")

"Grand opening!" Mayor Buttersworth announced to the crowd. "The Nutwobble Express! Direct service from Nutville Station to Grandmother Grove!"

Cheers erupted. Tony the Fox was already planning a "Tunnel Tour" business. Mrs. Hedgehog sold fountain-viewing tickets. The town was calling the ancient cave paintings a "historical treasure."

"We're heroes," Papa said, dazed, acorn halfway to his mouth. "How did we become heroes?"

"By failing spectacularly in exactly the right ways," Nutty said, writing in his notebook.

"What are you writing?" Mama asked.

Nutty showed her:

*Note to self: Next time, check if Grandma has explosives FIRST.*

*Secondary note: There is probably always a Grandma solution.*

*Third note: Upside-down calculators are NOT reliable.*

Grandma Nutwobble appeared beside them, holding a tray of fresh, WARM acorn cookies.

"These are still hot?" Papa asked, astonished.

"I walked here through the tunnel, dear. Took four minutes." Grandma smiled. "Who needs a detour when you've got family?"

"And dynamite," Nutty added.

"And dynamite," Grandma agreed. "Now eat your cookies. You've earned them."

The Nutwobble family sat together in the underground station they'd accidentally created, eating warm cookies and watching the town celebrate their catastrophic success.

"Best three days ever," Papa said with his mouth full.

"Best three days EVER," Mama agreed.

And somewhere beneath Nutville, in the ancient cave of their ancestors, the painted squirrels on the walls seemed to smile.

After all, a little chaos is a family tradition.

**THE END**

*P.S. - Mr. Mole eventually became the official Underground Toll Collector. He charges one acorn per trip. He says it's for "emotional damages." Nobody argues.*

*P.P.S. - Grandma still has one more secret TNT stash. She's saving it for something special.*

*P.P.P.S. - What could possibly go wrong?*
