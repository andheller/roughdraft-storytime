# Chapter 1: The Long Way Around

It was a beautiful Tuesday morning in Nutville, and Nutty Nutwobble was counting acorns when Tony the Fox came running up to their tree.

"TERRIBLE NEWS!" Tony shouted, nearly tripping over his own tail. "The Great Oak on Walnut Way fell down last night! The whole main path is blocked!"

Mama Nutwobble dropped down from the ceiling, where she'd been dusting at super-speed. "The main path? But that's how we get to Grandma's house!"

"How long until it's cleared?" Papa asked, nervously munching an acorn.

Tony shook his head. "At least two weeks. Maybe three. That oak was HUGE."

Nutty's whiskers drooped. "But Grandma's birthday party is THIS SATURDAY! We can't miss it!"

"There's always the detour," Tony said slowly. "Through Muddy Meadow, past Grumpy Badger's den, over Wobbly Bridge..."

The whole family shuddered.

Two hours later, the Nutwobbles finally arrived at Grandma's tree. They were covered in mud. Mama had leaves stuck in her tail from running too fast through the brambles. Papa had lost one of his shoes in the bog. And Nutty had been chased by Grumpy Badger for accidentally stepping on his welcome mat.

"There you are!" Grandma Nutwobble beamed from her porch. "I made fresh acorn cookies! They're still—"

She paused, looking at the sorry state of her family.

"They WERE still warm," she corrected. "That was two hours ago. What happened?"

"Detour," Papa groaned, collapsing into a chair.

Nutty bit into a cold cookie, thinking hard. His whiskers twitched. That twitch usually meant he was having an idea.

"What if," he said slowly, "we didn't go AROUND the blocked path?"

"We can't go through it, dear," Mama said. "The tree is enormous."

"I wasn't thinking through," Nutty said, his eyes lighting up. "I was thinking UNDER."

Papa stopped munching. "Under?"

"A TUNNEL!" Nutty pulled out his notebook and started sketching frantically. "We dig a direct tunnel from our tree to Grandma's! No more Muddy Meadow! No more Grumpy Badger! No more detours EVER!"

Mama zoomed around the room excitedly. "That's BRILLIANT! I love digging! I'm very fast at it!"

"How long would that take?" Grandma asked.

Nutty did some calculations. His face fell. "At our digging speed... about seven months."

"Well," Papa said, reaching for another cookie, "that's that, then. Pass the acorn butter?"

But Grandma was stroking her chin thoughtfully. "You know... your grandfather—rest his fuzzy soul—used to work in the old Nutville mine."

"There's a mine?" Nutty asked.

"Oh yes. Closed down years ago. But I remember he had some... supplies. Said they were for 'expedited excavation.'" She grinned. "He kept them in the storage tunnel behind the mine entrance. The crates should still be there."

Twenty minutes later, the Nutwobble family stood in the dusty darkness of the old mine, flashlights cutting through cobwebs. And there, stacked against the far wall, were a dozen wooden crates.

Each crate had big red letters on the side.

"T... N... T..." Nutty read slowly.

"Oh wonderful!" Papa said cheerfully. "What does TNT stand for? Terrific Nut Treats? Tasty Nibbling Time?"

Nutty's eyes went wide as he read the smaller print beneath. "'HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE. EXPLOSIVE. DO NOT DROP.'"

Papa's cookie froze halfway to his mouth. "Did you say... explosive?"

"DYNAMITE!" Mama gasped, her tail poofing up. "Your grandfather kept DYNAMITE?!"

Grandma shrugged. "He always said, 'Sometimes you need to move a lot of dirt in a hurry.' He was a practical squirrel."

Nutty was already scribbling calculations. "This is PERFECT! With the right amount of TNT, we could blast through the soil in DAYS instead of months!"

"Isn't that... dangerous?" Papa squeaked.

"Only if we use too much," Nutty assured him. "We just need to be scientific about it. Precise calculations. Careful measurements. We'll use just a tiny bit."

"Just a tiny bit," Papa repeated, not sounding convinced.

"A pinch!" Nutty said.

"A pinch of dynamite," Mama said, testing the words. "That sounds... almost reasonable?"

"What could possibly go wrong?" Nutty beamed.

Papa looked at the crates. He looked at his family. He looked at the crates again.

"I'm going to need more acorns for this," he muttered, pulling a handful from his pocket.

And so, with a wagon full of "vintage excavation supplies," the Nutwobbles headed home to dig a tunnel.

None of them noticed Grandma Nutwobble watching them go with a knowing smile.

Or the second stack of TNT crates hidden behind a dusty curtain in her attic.
