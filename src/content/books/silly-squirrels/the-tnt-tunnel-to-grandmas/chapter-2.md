# Chapter 2: Just a Pinch

The next morning, Nutty set up his workspace in the backyard. He had:
- His notebook (full of calculations)
- His safety goggles (slightly too big)
- His calculator (slightly sticky from acorn butter)
- One crate of TNT (slightly terrifying)

"Okay," he announced. "According to my calculations, we need exactly HALF a stick of dynamite to create a hole approximately three feet deep."

"That doesn't sound like a lot," Mama said hopefully.

"It's very scientific," Nutty assured her. "I accounted for soil density, moisture content, and root interference."

Papa held up an acorn. "Did you account for my nerves? Because my nerves are VERY interfered with right now."

Nutty carefully cut half a stick of TNT and placed it in a small hole. He unspooled a long fuse, and the family retreated behind a large rock.

"On three," Nutty said, holding a match. "One... two... THREE!"

He lit the fuse. It sparked and sizzled toward the explosive.

BOOM!

A column of dirt shot into the sky. Rocks rained down around them. A family of startled birds evacuated a nearby tree.

When the dust settled, they crept out to look.

"THAT'S THREE FEET?!" Papa shrieked.

The crater was the size of their entire house. Maybe bigger.

"I may have..." Nutty consulted his notebook, then his calculator, then his notebook again. "I may have put the decimal in the wrong place."

"YOU THINK?!"

"It's fine, it's fine," Mama said, zooming around the crater. "We just need to— wait. Do you hear that?"

From somewhere below came a muffled, grumpy voice:

"WHAT IN THE NAME OF EARTHWORMS WAS THAT?!"

They peered over the edge. The explosion had blown clean through into an underground room. And sitting in an armchair, covered in dirt and debris, was Mr. Mole. He was still holding a cup of tea. Most of it was now on his head.

"Oh dear," Mama whispered.

"Mr. Mole!" Nutty called down. "I'm SO sorry! I didn't know you lived here!"

Mr. Mole adjusted his tiny glasses and glared upward. "I have lived here for FORTY-THREE YEARS. This is my LIVING ROOM. That—" he pointed to a pile of rubble that used to be a lamp "—was my FAVORITE LAMP."

"We'll fix it!" Papa promised. "We'll fix everything!"

Two hours later, after patching Mr. Mole's ceiling with boards and buying him a new lamp (and apologizing seventeen times), the Nutwobbles regrouped.

"Okay," Nutty said, rechecking his calculator. "I see the problem. I was holding the calculator upside down."

"The calculator was upside down," Papa repeated flatly.

"Yes! So when I thought I calculated half a stick, I actually calculated—" Nutty paused. "Well, the point is, we use MUCH less this time!"

"How much less?" Mama asked.

Nutty held up a tiny piece of TNT, barely bigger than an acorn. "A PINCH. Just a pinch. This will create a nice, modest, perfectly reasonable hole."

Papa wasn't convinced. "You said 'perfectly reasonable' last time."

"Last time was a learning experience. Now I'm learned!"

They moved to a new spot, far from Mr. Mole's reconstructed living room. Nutty placed the tiny piece of TNT, unspooled the fuse, and retreated.

"This time," he promised, "will be different."

BOOOOOM!!!

The explosion was somehow THREE TIMES bigger than before.

The ground shook. Windows rattled in Nutville half a mile away. A geyser of dirt rose so high it almost touched the clouds.

When the dust cleared, the Nutwobbles uncovered themselves from the pile of dirt they were buried under.

"HOW?!" Papa sputtered, spitting out pebbles. "IT WAS SMALLER!"

Nutty stared at his calculator in betrayal. "I don't... the math... it was definitely..." He looked closer. "Oh. The batteries were in backwards."

Mama dug herself out and peered into the ENORMOUS new crater. Then she gasped.

"Nutty. Papa. Come look at this!"

Deep in the crater, the explosion had blasted into a cave. But not just any cave—the walls were covered in PAINTINGS. Ancient paintings of squirrels. Squirrels gathering acorns. Squirrels building things. Squirrels that looked like they were... dancing?

"What IS this place?" Nutty breathed.

They climbed carefully down. The paintings were faded but beautiful, covering every surface.

"These must be from our ancestors!" Papa said, genuinely amazed. "Ancient Nutville squirrels!"

"Look at this one!" Mama pointed to a painting that showed squirrels around a fire, with something round cooking on top. "I think... I think it's a recipe!"

Nutty squinted at the symbols beneath the image. "Acorn... soup? They painted their RECIPES on the walls!"

"To be fair," Papa said, pulling out a snack, "acorn soup IS worth immortalizing."

They spent an hour exploring the cave, finding more paintings: squirrels fishing, squirrels singing, squirrels riding on the backs of very patient turtles.

"This is incredible," Nutty said, taking notes. "We discovered ancient history! By accident!"

"Very expensive accident," Papa muttered, looking at their dwindling supply of TNT.

As they climbed back out, Nutty studied his notes. "We've learned a lot today."

"Have we?" Papa asked.

"Yes! One: my calculator needs new batteries. Two: my calculator should be right-side up. Three: check for moles BEFORE blasting. And four: our ancestors had excellent taste in soup."

Mama brushed dirt off her tail. "So what now? We're no closer to a tunnel to Grandma's."

Nutty looked at the remaining crates. Then at his notebook. Then at the sun setting over Nutville.

"Tomorrow," he said firmly, "we try again. But THIS time, Papa does the math."

Papa choked on his acorn. "ME?!"

"You're good at counting!"

"I count SNACKS! Not EXPLOSIVES!"

"Perfect! It's all just numbers!" Nutty patted his father on the back. "What could possibly go wrong?"

Papa looked into the ancient cave they'd just accidentally discovered. He looked at the house-sized craters. He looked at his son's optimistic face.

He pulled out more acorns.

He was going to need them.
