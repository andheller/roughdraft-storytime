# Chapter 3: The Boom Heard 'Round Nutville

"I've got it!" Papa announced proudly the next morning, holding up a piece of paper covered in acorn-shaped doodles and numbers. "I counted on my fingers, my toes, AND borrowed some of Nutty's toes. The answer is TWELVE!"

"Twelve what?" Nutty asked.

"Yes!"

Mama tilted her head. "What does twelve have to do with how much TNT we need?"

Papa's confident smile wavered. "It's... a very important number?"

Nutty sighed and took the paper. He squinted at Papa's calculations. There were more drawings of acorns than actual math, and at one point Papa had written "carry the acorn" instead of "carry the one."

"Papa," Nutty said carefully, "you just calculated how many snacks we have left."

"That IS important!"

"Let me see those calculations," Mama said, zooming over. She studied the paper for exactly half a second. "What if we combine our methods? Nutty does the science, Papa counts the sticks, and I'll be in charge of running away from explosions."

"I'm VERY good at that part," Papa agreed.

They spent the morning carefully preparing. Nutty triple-checked his calculator (new batteries, right-side up, definitely not covered in acorn butter this time). Papa counted the dynamite sticks out loud, twice, while Mama zipped around setting up safety barriers.

"Okay," Nutty said finally. "Based on my CORRECTED calculations, if we place four sticks at strategic points along this line"—he drew in the dirt—"we should create a nice, straight tunnel heading toward Grandma's house."

"Should?" Papa squeaked.

"Will! Definitely will. Probably. Almost certainly!"

They placed the four sticks of dynamite in a row, each one buried in its own little hole. Nutty connected them all with fuses that led to a single main fuse.

"This way," he explained, "they'll all go off at once, in a controlled chain reaction!"

"You said 'chain reaction,'" Papa whimpered. "That sounds like a lot of reactions."

"Papa, do you trust me?"

Papa looked at the craters from yesterday. "Not really!"

"Perfect! Your caution will keep us safe!" Nutty lit the fuse. "RUN!"

Mama grabbed both of them and ZOOMED behind the safety barrier in a blur of fur.

For three seconds, nothing happened.

Then: BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The four explosions went off in sequence, just like Nutty planned. The ground shook. Dirt flew.

"It's working!" Nutty cheered.

Then: BOOM! BOOM-BOOM! BA-BOOM!

"What was THAT?!" Papa shrieked.

BOOM! BOOM! KA-BLAM! BOOM-BOOM-BOOOOOM!

The explosions were spreading. The old mine tunnels—ancient, forgotten tunnels that crisscrossed beneath Nutville—were catching the blast and carrying it throughout the town.

Explosions popped up everywhere like the world's most dangerous game of whack-a-mole.

BOOM! A geyser of water erupted in Mrs. Hedgehog's garden. (Her water pipes.)

BOOM! The town square suddenly had a new amphitheater. (Nobody had asked for one.)

BOOM! Mayor Buttersworth's office now featured a skylight. (Also unplanned.)

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The Nutwobbles watched in horror as columns of dirt and debris shot up all across Nutville. Screams and shouts echoed through the air. Someone yelled, "MY CABBAGES!"

After what felt like forever, the booming finally stopped.

Silence.

Then, slowly, residents emerged from their homes, covered in dust, staring at the chaos.

Nutty, Mama, and Papa crept out from behind their barrier. The backyard was... well, it was mostly holes now. The entire property looked like Swiss cheese.

"Is everyone okay?!" Mama called out.

Miraculously, everyone was. Confused, dirty, and slightly singed, but okay.

Mr. Mole's head popped up from one of the new holes. "AGAIN?! SERIOUSLY?!"

"We're so sorry!" the Nutwobbles said together.

Town residents gathered around, assessing the damage. But as they explored, something unexpected happened.

"Hey!" called Mrs. Hedgehog from her garden. "This burst pipe! It's like a fountain now! It's actually... quite lovely?"

"The amphitheater is pretty nice!" someone said from the town square. "We could do concerts here!"

"I've always wanted a skylight," Mayor Buttersworth admitted, peering up at the hole in his roof. "Natural lighting! Very modern!"

"And LOOK!" Tony the Fox's voice echoed from underground. He emerged from a hole near the bakery, eyes wide. "These tunnels connect EVERYTHING! I can walk from the bakery to the library to the schoolhouse—all underground! No more rain! No more snow! It's AMAZING!"

The town's grumbling slowly turned to excited chatter. The Nutwobbles' disaster had accidentally created an underground transportation network.

"We're... not in trouble?" Papa asked in disbelief.

"This is INCREDIBLE!" Mayor Buttersworth announced. "The Nutville Underground! Tourism! Convenience! We'll be famous!"

Nutty should have felt proud. Instead, he was staring at his notes with a frown.

"What's wrong?" Mama asked.

Nutty pointed in the direction of Grandma's house. "The tunnels go everywhere. To the bakery. To the school. To the library. Under the whole town."

"Yes, it's wonderful!"

"But NONE of them go to Grandma's house."

Mama's face fell. Papa stopped mid-celebratory-acorn.

They'd created an entire underground network. They'd accidentally become town heroes. But the one tunnel they actually NEEDED?

They'd blown up all their TNT, and the path to Grandma's was still blocked.

"How much dynamite do we have left?" Mama asked quietly.

Nutty checked the wagon. Empty. He checked the crates. Empty.

"None," he said. "Zero. We used it all."

Papa slumped. "So after all that... we STILL have to take the muddy detour?"

The family stood in the middle of their crater-filled backyard, surrounded by the cheering chaos of Nutville's new underground wonder.

So close. So far. So many explosions. And yet...

"I guess we walk the long way," Nutty sighed. "At least we'll get there eventually."

"Through the mud," Papa moaned.

"Past Grumpy Badger," Mama added.

"With cold cookies at the end," Nutty finished.

They gathered their things sadly and headed for the detour.

None of them heard the distant BOOM that echoed from the direction of Grandma's house.

Or saw the small plume of smoke rising over the treetops.
