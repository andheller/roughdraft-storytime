# Building the Machine That's Already Built But Also Isn't

The Nutwobble family stared at the pile of parts that were somehow both assembled and not assembled at the same time.

"So," Mama said, picking up a rubber band, "where do we start?"

The rubber band immediately snapped itself around two alarm clocks.

"I guess we start there?" Mama said, watching the rubber band tie itself into an intricate knot pattern.

"This is the weirdest construction project ever," Papa observed, as a screwdriver lifted itself out of the toolbox and started unscrewing a screw that wasn't there yet. Or was already there? Or was going to have been there?

Nutty consulted the note he'd written to himself. Or that he was going to write. Or had already written. Time grammar was getting really confusing.

"According to Future-Past-Me," Nutty read, "we need to connect the alarm clocks to the bicycle wheel using the rubber bands, then mount the disco ball in the center, and use the jellybeans as—" He paused. "As a 'temporal calibration medium.' What does that even mean?"

"It means the jellybeans tell us what time it is!" Papa said confidently.

"How can jellybeans tell time?" Mama asked.

Papa held up a jellybean. It was currently rotating through different colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and back to red. "Because they're doing this!"

"That's... actually really weird," Nutty admitted. "Even for backwards-time jellybeans."

As they worked (or unworked?), more strange things kept happening around Nutville. Through the window, they could see:

- Mrs. Hedgehog's garden where flowers were growing, wilting, and blooming again all at the same time
- Tony delivering packages to houses, then walking backwards away from houses while the packages were still in his hands
- Mr. Rabbit's house had given up on picking an orientation and was now just gently rotating like a very slow, very confused carousel
- A flock of birds spelling out words in the sky, except the words were backwards: "PLEH" they wrote, which everyone assumed meant "HELP" but backwards

"We need to hurry," Mama said, connecting the bicycle wheel to the disco ball using a series of rubber bands that kept trying to snap themselves in the wrong (or right?) direction.

"Or do we need to slow down?" Papa wondered. "If time is backwards, maybe hurrying makes us slower?"

To test this, Nutty tried moving very slowly toward the toolbox. He immediately zoomed across the room at super speed and crashed into the wall.

"OW! Okay, that's not how it works!" Nutty rubbed his head, which somehow didn't hurt until AFTER he said it hurt.

The machine was starting to take shape. Or un-take shape. It was hard to tell. The disco ball hung in the center, connected to the bicycle wheel, which was connected to six alarm clocks (when did the other two appear?), all of which were ticking at different speeds and somehow all showing the same time despite moving at different rates.

"Now for the fizzy cola," Nutty said, eyeing the six bottles nervously. "According to my future-past notes, we need to use it as a 'temporal propulsion fluid.'"

"That sounds dangerous," Mama observed.

"Dangerous is our middle name!" Papa declared.

"Actually, your middle name is Herbert," Mama pointed out.

"Dangerous Herbert is ALSO our middle name!" Papa amended.

They carefully began incorporating the fizzy cola bottles into the machine. Each bottle was connected to an alarm clock with a series of tubes made from... wait, when did they have tubes? There definitely weren't tubes in the original crate.

"Did we make these tubes?" Nutty asked, holding up a curly transparent tube.

"I don't think so?" Mama replied.

Just then, a small tube-making machine appeared in the corner of the room with a note attached: "Thought you might need this! - The Hardware Store (P.S. You already paid for it tomorrow)"

"I love backwards time," Papa grinned. "We can buy things after we need them but before we get them!"

"That's not how—never mind," Mama sighed. "Let's just finish this before my brain completely breaks."

As they connected the last tubes, something remarkable happened. All the jellybeans suddenly floated up into the air and arranged themselves in a perfect spiral around the disco ball. Then they started glowing. Each jellybean was a different color, and they pulsed in a rhythm that almost sounded like music, if music could be backwards and forwards at the same time.

"It's... beautiful," Nutty whispered.

The alarm clocks all started ringing at once, except they were ringing backwards, which sounded like someone trying to sing opera while inhaling instead of exhaling. The bicycle wheel started spinning—both directions at once—and the disco ball began to sparkle with light that was somehow rainbow-colored but also clear.

"I think it's working!" Mama shouted over the backwards alarm-clock opera.

"Or it's about to stop working!" Papa corrected.

"BOTH!" Nutty yelled.

The fizzy cola in the bottles started bubbling. Not just normal fizzy bubbling, but REALLY enthusiastic bubbling. The kind of bubbling that suggests the cola is very excited about something and might be planning to do something dramatic about it.

"Uh, is it supposed to bubble like that?" Mama asked nervously.

Nutty checked his notes. "According to Future-Past-Me, the bubbling means the machine is 'reaching critical temporal displacement' and we should 'probably stand back.'"

"PROBABLY?!" Papa squeaked.

"That's what it says!" Nutty showed them the note.

All three squirrels took several steps back.

The machine hummed louder. The jellybeans glowed brighter. The disco ball spun faster (and slower?) at the same time. The alarm clocks all showed different times: 3:00, 7:15, 12:30, 9:45, 2:00, and somehow also all showed "Tuesday" despite that not being a time.

Then something clicked inside the machine.

Or un-clicked.

Or both.

A wave of shimmering, rainbow-colored energy pulsed out from the disco ball. It rippled through the room like a soap bubble made of time itself. When it passed over the squirrels, they felt the strangest sensation—like they were moving forward and backward through time simultaneously, like they were in two places at once, like yesterday and tomorrow were having a meeting inside their brains.

"THAT WAS WEIRD!" all three shouted at the same time, except Papa shouted it first, Mama shouted it last, and Nutty shouted it in the middle, even though they all started at the same moment.

Outside the window, Nutville looked even stranger now. Some houses were upside down, some were sideways, and Mr. Rabbit's house had apparently given up entirely and was now simply a house-shaped cloud of confusion gently floating three feet above its foundation.

"Did we fix it?" Papa asked hopefully.

"I don't think so," Nutty said, watching as a tree outside sprouted leaves, lost them, grew them back, and then turned into an acorn before growing back into a tree again.

"Did we make it worse?" Mama worried.

"Definitely," Nutty confirmed.

The machine hummed louder, a sound like a thousand tiny disco parties happening backwards while alarm clocks sang opera and jellybeans contemplated the nature of existence.

"So," Papa said carefully, "what now?"

Nutty looked at his notes again. The bottom of the page had one more line, written in increasingly shaky handwriting:

"If you've gotten this far, congratulations! You've successfully activated the Backwards-Time Temporal Displacement Device! Don't worry about the humming noise. Or the glowing. Or the way reality seems to be folding in on itself. That's all perfectly normal. Probably. The next step is to— OH NO IT'S GETTING REALLY FIZZY NOW I SHOULD PROB—"

The note ended there.

"That's... not encouraging," Mama said.

The fizzy cola bottles were now bubbling so vigorously that they were starting to shake. Little drops of cola were floating upward instead of dripping downward, and they were forming patterns in the air that looked suspiciously like warning signs.

"Um," Nutty said, his scientific curiosity now mixed with a healthy dose of concern, "I think we might have a small problem."

"Small?" Papa pointed at the machine, which was now surrounded by a swirling vortex of backwards time, jellybeans, and what appeared to be tomorrow's weather forecast.

"Okay, a MEDIUM problem," Nutty amended.

One of the cola bottles started whistling. Not metaphorically whistling like a teakettle—literally whistling the tune to "Happy Birthday" backwards.

"Make that a LARGE problem," Nutty revised.

"WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BIGGER PLAN!" Mama shouted.

"Or a smaller machine!" Papa suggested.

"Or a time machine to go back and prevent us from building this time machine!" Nutty added.

All three looked at each other.

"Wait," they said simultaneously, "isn't that what we're trying to do?"

The machine hummed in what might have been agreement, or might have been the sound of six alarm clocks realizing they were all about to have a very bad day.

"Hold on tight!" Nutty yelled. "I think things are about to get REALLY weird!"

"REALLY weird?" Papa laughed hysterically. "As opposed to the perfectly normal situation we're currently in?"

Before anyone could respond, the machine pulsed again, and every clock in Nutville started running backwards while somehow also running forwards, and time itself decided it might be time for a coffee break to figure out what on earth it was supposed to be doing.
