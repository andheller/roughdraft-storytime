# The Great Temporal Chaos Cascade (Or: Everything Everywhere All at Wrong Times)

Things were officially out of control.

The Backwards-Time Temporal Displacement Device (which they were now calling "Bob" because it was easier to say when you were panicking) had somehow become even MORE active. The jellybeans were now floating in complex geometric patterns while humming show tunes from musicals that hadn't been written yet. Or had been written in the past. Or were currently being written by someone who didn't exist yet.

Time grammar was REALLY breaking down.

"Okay," Nutty said, trying to stay calm while watching his tail exist in three different time periods simultaneously. "Let's assess the situation logically—"

"Nutty," Mama interrupted, "you just said that sentence backwards but it came out forwards."

"Did I?" Nutty replied. Except his mouth moved AFTER the words came out.

"This is fine," Papa said, even though he was clearly not fine, as evidenced by the fact that he was currently standing on the ceiling while gravity tried to decide which direction should be down. "Everything is PERFECTLY fine."

A knock came on the door. Except it wasn't so much a knock as the door knocking itself, rhythmically, to a beat that sounded suspiciously like disco music.

Mama opened it to find Mrs. Hedgehog, Mr. Rabbit, Tony the Delivery Fox, and about half of Nutville standing outside. They all looked various degrees of confused, concerned, and somehow also relieved?

"Thank you for fixing this!" Mrs. Hedgehog said, even though nothing was fixed.

"We appreciate you solving the problem!" Mr. Rabbit added, even though the problem was clearly getting worse.

"Great job on the explosion!" Tony said cheerfully.

"What explosion?" all three Nutwobbles said at once.

"The explosion that's about to happen!" Tony explained, as if this made perfect sense. "Or that already happened? Look, I've given up trying to understand time. I just know that you three are heroes, and I brought you these medals!"

He handed them three shiny medals that said "For Heroic Backwards Time Management."

"But we haven't managed anything!" Nutty protested, taking the medal anyway because it would be rude not to.

"Yet!" Mrs. Hedgehog corrected. "Or already? Oh dear, I've confused myself again."

Inside the house, Bob the machine was now doing something that could only be described as "aggressively existing." The disco ball was spinning so fast it was moving backwards through space, the alarm clocks were playing a symphony (all in different keys, all backwards), and the fizzy cola was bubbling with the enthusiasm of a thousand tiny excited volcanoes.

"Everyone should probably stand back," Mama suggested to the crowd.

Instead, everyone crowded closer, because apparently backwards time made people do the opposite of sensible things.

Suddenly, the machine pulsed again, and reality did something that reality probably shouldn't do: it hiccupped.

When reality hiccups, strange things happen:

- Mr. Rabbit's house, which had been floating, decided to become a liquid and poured itself into a house-shaped puddle on the ground, where it then resolidified as a perfectly normal house, but upside down.

- All the birds in Nutville started flying in formation, spelling out increasingly concerning messages: "SOMETHING FIZZY THIS WAY COMES" and "IN SPACE NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU BUBBLE" and "HAVE YOU TRIED TURNING IT OFF AND ON AGAIN?"

- Tony's delivery truck transformed into a bicycle, then a skateboard, then a pair of roller skates, then briefly became a potato, before settling back into being a truck (but smaller, and somehow nervous-looking).

- Mrs. Hedgehog's carrots started having philosophical discussions about the nature of vegetables.

"Are we sure this is safe?" Papa asked, as his left ear briefly existed in next Tuesday.

"Nothing about this is safe!" Nutty laughed, because at this point, what else could you do but laugh? "But I think I'm starting to understand what's happening!"

"PLEASE SHARE WITH THE CLASS," Mama shouted over the sound of reality questioning its life choices.

"The machine isn't JUST making time go backwards," Nutty explained excitedly, "it's making time go EVERY direction! Up, down, sideways, diagonal, and probably several directions that don't have names yet!"

"That's terrible!" Papa said.

"That's AMAZING!" Nutty corrected. "Don't you see? If time is going every direction, then somewhere in all this chaos, there's a timeline where we've already fixed everything!"

"So we just need to find that timeline?" Mama asked.

"Exactly! Or let it find us! Or we're already in it! Or we will have been in it soon!"

One of the fizzy cola bottles suddenly popped its cap and started spraying fizzy cola everywhere. But the cola wasn't falling down—it was falling in ALL directions. Some drops went up, some went sideways, some went diagonal, and a few drops just gave up and floated in mid-air, contemplating their existence.

"The cola is getting unstable!" Papa observed, unnecessarily, since this was obvious to everyone, including the cola itself.

"We need to stabilize it!" Mama said.

"With what?" Nutty looked around frantically.

As if in answer, a package materialized on the floor with a label that said: "Emergency Backwards-Time Stabilization Kit - From the Department of Temporal Accidents That Haven't Happened Yet."

They opened it. Inside were:
- One rubber chicken (for reasons that were unclear)
- A jar of pickles labeled "Handle with Care - Contains Yesterday's Tomorrow"
- A instruction manual written entirely in emoji
- A video tape labeled "Play Me Forwards While Watching Backwards"
- And a note that said "Sorry, wrong universe" with a frowny face

"This is the WORST emergency kit ever!" Mama exclaimed.

"Or the BEST!" Nutty argued. "We just have to use it backwards!"

He grabbed the rubber chicken and threw it AT the machine.

The chicken flew through the air, backwards, while somehow still moving forward, and when it touched the disco ball, it squeaked in a tone that could only be described as "B-flat in the key of Tuesday."

The machine responded by humming louder and releasing another wave of temporal energy.

This time, when the wave hit, everyone experienced the most peculiar sensation: they could remember things that hadn't happened yet, forgot things that were currently happening, and felt nostalgic for moments that were occurring right now.

"I miss this moment," Papa said wistfully, even though he was still in the moment.

"I'm looking forward to five seconds ago," Mrs. Hedgehog added.

"My memories are happening in alphabetical order!" Mr. Rabbit cried out.

The disco ball suddenly spoke. It actually SPOKE, in a voice that sounded like a game show host mixed with a philosophy professor mixed with a disco DJ:

"ATTENTION TEMPORAL PARTICIPANTS! YOU HAVE REACHED MAXIMUM BACKWARDS CAPACITY! PLEASE PREPARE FOR FORWARDS RE-INITIALIZATION! OR BACKWARDS DE-INITIALIZATION! OR POSSIBLY SIDEWAYS MIDDLEIZATION! THE MANAGEMENT APOLOGIZES FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE CAUSED BY EXISTING IN TIME!"

"The disco ball is talking," Mama said flatly.

"Why not?" Nutty shrugged. "Everything else has gone weird, why shouldn't disco balls gain sentience?"

"THAT'S NOT HOW PHYSICS WORKS!" Mama shouted.

"Physics called in sick today!" the disco ball announced. "I'm covering its shift! Please direct all complaints to the Department of Why Is This Happening, located at the intersection of How and What!"

The alarm clocks all started ringing again, but now they were ringing in harmony, creating a beautiful backwards symphony that somehow sounded like it was about to end at any moment, even though it felt like it had just started.

The fizzy cola bottles were ALL bubbling now, so vigorously that they were starting to glow. First a soft orange glow, then yellow, then white-hot, like tiny suns made of carbonated beverage.

"Uh oh," Nutty said.

"Uh oh?" Papa repeated.

"Yeah, definitely uh oh," Nutty confirmed. "According to the laws of backwards physics that I just made up, when fizzy cola reaches white-hot temperature, it means—"

"BRACE FOR TEMPORAL EXPLOSION!" the disco ball interrupted. "THIS IS NOT A DRILL! EXCEPT IT IS A DRILL! BUT FROM THE FUTURE! OR PAST! PLEASE ASSUME THE EMERGENCY POSITION!"

"What's the emergency position?!" everyone shouted.

"I DON'T KNOW, I'M A DISCO BALL!" it shouted back. "I MAKE LIGHT AND SPIN! THAT'S MY WHOLE THING! WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR SAFETY ADVICE?!"

The machine started shaking. The jellybeans started glowing so bright they were hard to look at. The rubber bands were stretching and snapping back in rhythms that defied all understanding of elasticity. The bicycle wheel was spinning so fast it was practically inventing new dimensions.

And the fizzy cola?

The fizzy cola was about to have the most spectacular, most explosive, most magnificently messy moment of its entire carbonated life.

"EVERYONE GET DOWN!" Nutty yelled.

"Or get up!" Papa added, since backwards time made it unclear which was safer.

"JUST GET SOMEWHERE!" Mama compromised.

The machine let out one final, prolonged, musical note that sounded like the universe taking a deep breath before doing something it probably shouldn't do but was going to do anyway because it was committed now and there was no backing out.

The fizzy cola bottles began to whistle.

Not just one whistle—ALL of them, in perfect harmony, creating a sound that was part tea kettle, part rocket ship, part "uh oh that's probably not good."

"THIS IS IT!" the disco ball announced dramatically. "THE BIG FINALE! THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR! OR HAVE ALREADY SEEN! OR WILL NEVER SEE BECAUSE TIME IS CONFUSING!"

Nutty grabbed Mama's hand. Mama grabbed Papa's hand. Papa grabbed Nutty's other hand, completing the circle of family unity in the face of temporal disaster.

"Whatever happens," Nutty said, "at least we're together!"

"And at least it's going to be spectacular!" Papa added optimistically.

"And at least we can say we tried!" Mama finished.

The machine glowed brighter.

And brighter.

And BRIGHTER.

The fizzy cola reached its absolute limit of fizziness.

Reality held its breath.

Time grabbed some popcorn to watch.

And then...

Chapter 4 ends here, on the edge of the most explosive moment in Nutville's history, with everything about to happen all at once, backwards, forwards, and sideways, in the most ridiculously spectacular way imaginable.
