# The Investigation That Makes Absolutely No Sense

The Nutwobble family decided to start their investigation by walking around Nutville to see if anyone else was experiencing the backwards weirdness.

"Let's start by asking Mrs. Hedgehog about her garden," Mama suggested.

But before they could even reach her house, Mrs. Hedgehog appeared at their gate, holding a basket of perfectly normal-looking carrots.

"Oh, thank goodness you're here!" she exclaimed. "My carrots are growing downward into the sky! Can you help?"

The three squirrels looked at her garden. The carrots were growing completely normally, down in the dirt, like carrots are supposed to.

"Mrs. Hedgehog," Nutty said carefully, "your carrots look perfectly fine to me."

"They do NOW!" she said. "That's because you're about to help me fix them!"

"But... they're already fixed?" Papa pointed out.

"Exactly! Thank you!" Mrs. Hedgehog beamed and walked away backwards into her house.

"I'm so confused," Mama whispered.

"Join the club," Nutty muttered, writing in his notebook: "Carrots: fixed before broken? Broken after fixed? Help."

They continued down the street, where they encountered Mr. Rabbit, who was standing on his porch holding a large umbrella, even though the sky was perfectly clear and sunny.

"Mr. Rabbit," Nutty called out, "why do you have an umbrella?"

"For the rain, obviously!" Mr. Rabbit replied, looking at them like THEY were the weird ones.

"It's not raining," Mama pointed out.

"Not YET," Mr. Rabbit said ominously. "But it's definitely going to have been raining soon."

"That sentence hurt my brain," Papa groaned.

Just then, a single rain boot materialized out of thin air and landed on the sidewalk in front of them with a soft "thunk."

They all stared at it.

"Is that..." Mama started.

"...a rain boot?" Nutty finished.

"Just appearing out of nowhere?" Papa added.

A second rain boot appeared next to the first one. Then a raincoat. Then an umbrella folded itself closed and gently set itself down beside the boots.

"Okay," Nutty said, pulling out his pencil. "So rain gear is appearing. Which means..."

Five minutes later, it started raining.

"THAT'S NOT HOW WEATHER WORKS!" Mama shouted at the sky.

The rain shouted back. Or at least, it sounded like it did. Actually, what happened was a thunderclap, but it happened BEFORE the lightning flash, which was definitely backwards.

They ran for cover under a nearby tree (which was probably not the safest choice during a thunderstorm, but in their defense, nothing made sense anymore, so why should safety precautions?).

"Alright," Nutty said, shaking raindrops off his tail. "Let me try something. I'm going to ask a question, and I want you both to wait to hear my full question before answering. Ready?"

"Ready!" Mama said.

"Okay, here goes: What do you think we should—"

"Build a Time Detective Device!" Papa interrupted.

"—do next," Nutty finished. "Wait, Papa, you answered before I finished my question!"

"Did I?" Papa looked confused. "That's weird. I didn't mean to. The answer just... came out."

"Because the answer came before the question," Mama realized. "Oh, this is getting ridiculous."

"It was already ridiculous!" Nutty laughed, despite how confusing everything was. "But you're right, Papa! We SHOULD build a Time Detective Device! Wait, should we? I didn't even know that was an option until you said it!"

"I didn't know it was an option until I said it either!" Papa admitted.

By now the rain had stopped, and a rainbow appeared in the sky. Except it was upside down. And the colors were in reverse order. And it was somehow making a humming noise.

"Is that rainbow... humming?" Mama asked.

"Everything is weird, so why shouldn't rainbows hum?" Nutty reasoned.

They decided to head back home to start building the Time Detective Device, whatever that was. On the way, they encountered Tony the Delivery Fox again, who was walking his usual route but somehow moving in reverse while looking like he was going forward.

"Tony!" Nutty called. "Are you experiencing any weirdness today?"

"Weirdness?" Tony stopped (or started? It was hard to tell). "Like what?"

"Like... time being backwards? Effects before causes? Pizza arriving before it's ordered?"

Tony thought about this. "You know, now that you mention it, I've been getting thank-you notes all morning for deliveries I haven't made yet. One lady gave me a tip for a package I'm supposed to deliver tomorrow!"

"See! It's not just us!" Nutty said triumphantly.

"Although," Tony continued, pulling out a small notebook, "I also have this weird list in my pocket of all the deliveries I'm going to make today, but it's written in reverse order, and half of them I've already delivered even though they're on my 'future deliveries' list. Does that make sense?"

"Nothing makes sense anymore," Mama said wearily.

"That's the spirit!" Papa said cheerfully, because Papa was always weirdly optimistic about chaos.

When they got home, they found that the crate of parts in their living room had somehow partially assembled itself. The rubber bands were connected to the alarm clocks, which were connected to... wait, were those jellybeans being used as some sort of timing mechanism?

"Did we build this?" Nutty wondered.

"I don't think so?" Mama said, but she didn't sound sure.

"Maybe we're going to build it?" Papa suggested.

As if responding to his words, a screwdriver floated up from the toolbox and positioned itself in Nutty's hand, right where he would need it if he were going to tighten a screw. A screw that was already tightened. But also somehow loose?

"This is impossible," Nutty declared.

"Impossibly SILLY!" Papa corrected.

"Impossibly silly and getting more impossible by the minute!" Mama added, watching as the bicycle wheel suddenly started spinning on its own, backwards, while somehow moving forward through time.

Nutty sat down on the floor, his head spinning. "Okay, let's think about this logically—"

"Logically?" Mama raised an eyebrow.

"Fine, let's think about this ILLOGICALLY," Nutty amended. "If time is backwards, and effects happen before causes, then..."

He trailed off because a light bulb appeared over his head. An actual, physical light bulb, floating in midair, glowing brightly.

"DID THAT JUST APPEAR BECAUSE I'M HAVING AN IDEA?" Nutty shouted.

"Apparently!" Mama stared at the floating light bulb.

"This is AMAZING!" Nutty laughed. "I haven't even HAD the idea yet, but the light bulb already appeared because I'm GOING to have it!"

"What's the idea?" Papa asked eagerly.

"I don't know yet! It hasn't happened!" Nutty grinned. "But apparently it's going to be a bright one!"

They all stared at the glowing light bulb for a moment.

Then Nutty gasped. "THAT'S IT! If everything is backwards, then maybe we don't need to BUILD a Time Detective Device—maybe we need to UNBUILD one!"

"Unbuild?" Mama and Papa said together.

"Or... wait." Nutty's eyes went wide. "What if we've ALREADY built it? What if that's what this pile of parts is? What if it's already working, and that's WHY everything is backwards?"

The light bulb above his head got brighter.

"So," Papa said slowly, "we need to figure out how to stop a machine that we've already built but don't remember building, which is causing time to go backwards, which means we experienced building it in reverse, which means we actually took it apart but from our perspective we're going to put it together?"

The light bulb exploded in a shower of sparkles.

"Ow, my brain," Mama whimpered.

"I think Papa just figured it out!" Nutty cheered. "We have to assemble the machine to stop it, because assembling it backwards is actually taking it apart forwards!"

"That makes no sense at all," Mama said.

"EXACTLY!" both Nutty and Papa shouted.

"So we build it?" Mama confirmed, looking at the pile of increasingly organized parts.

"We build it!" Nutty agreed.

Outside, a bird flew past their window, backwards, while chirping forwards, and somehow doing a loop-de-loop sideways through what appeared to be Tuesday afternoon but was also somehow still Tuesday morning.

"Let's get started before things get even weirder," Mama suggested.

"Too late!" Papa pointed out the window, where Mr. Rabbit's house was now upside down. Or right-side up. Or possibly sideways. It was hard to tell because it kept rotating through all three orientations at once.

"Okay, REALLY let's get started before things get EVEN WEIRDER than that," Mama revised.

They gathered around the pile of parts, ready to build (or unbuild?) the most ridiculous Time Detective Device that had ever been assembled in reverse chronological order by three very confused but determined squirrels.

"On the count of three," Nutty said. "One... two..."

"Three!" all three said together.

Except Papa said it first, even though Nutty was the one counting.

"That's it," Mama sighed. "I'm going to need so many acorns after this is over."
