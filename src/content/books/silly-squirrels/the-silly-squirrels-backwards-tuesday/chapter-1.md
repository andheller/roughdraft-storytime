# The Day That Started at the End

It was a perfectly ordinary Tuesday morning in Nutville. Except it absolutely, positively, definitely was NOT.

Nutty woke up to find a large golden trophy sitting on his nightstand. Engraved on the front were the words: "CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MOST EXPLOSIVE SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY - The Mayor of Nutville."

"That's weird," Nutty mumbled, rubbing his eyes. "I don't remember discovering anything explosive. Or discovering anything at all. Or even being awake yet."

He stumbled downstairs where Mama Nutwobble was staring at a thank-you card on the kitchen table.

"Dear Mama, Papa, and Nutty," she read aloud in a confused voice, "Thank you SO much for saving Nutville from the Great Backwards Catastrophe. Without your brave actions and completely ridiculous science experiment, who knows what would have happened! Love, Mayor Buttersworth."

"The what catastrophe?" Mama looked up at Nutty. "What science experiment? What backwards? WHAT IS HAPPENING?"

Papa Nutwobble walked in from the backyard, wearing a helmet, safety goggles, and thick rubber gloves. He looked down at his outfit in confusion.

"Why am I dressed like this?" he wondered aloud. "I don't remember putting these on. I was going to make waffles!"

"Papa, forget your fashion choices for a second—come look at this!" Nutty pointed out the window to their backyard.

There, in the middle of their favorite acorn tree, were massive scorch marks. The grass around it was singed in a perfect circle. But nothing was currently on fire. In fact, nothing LOOKED like it had been on fire recently. The scorch marks looked... somehow fresh and old at the same time?

"Did we have a barbecue?" Papa asked hopefully. "Because I don't remember eating anything, and now I'm hungry."

"No, Papa, we didn't—wait, hold on." Nutty sniffed the air. "Do you smell... jellybeans? And... disco?"

"Disco doesn't have a smell, dear," Mama said, then paused. "Does it?"

Just then, Mrs. Hedgehog knocked on their door. Before anyone could answer, she opened it and poked her head in.

"Thank you!" she chirped cheerfully. "Simply THANK YOU! My garden has never looked better after you helped me yesterday! Those backwards-growing carrots are finally growing the right way again!"

"We... helped your garden?" Mama asked carefully. "When did we do that?"

"Yesterday, of course! Don't you remember? You came over and—oh dear, you look confused. Are you feeling alright?" Mrs. Hedgehog looked concerned.

"We're feeling... something," Nutty admitted.

After Mrs. Hedgehog left (still thanking them profusely for something they definitely didn't remember doing), the three squirrels sat around the kitchen table, staring at the trophy, the thank-you card, and Papa's inexplicable safety equipment.

"Okay," Nutty said, pulling out his notebook. "Let's make a list of weird things:

1. Trophy for explosive discovery we didn't make
2. Thank-you card for catastrophe we didn't prevent
3. Papa is wearing safety gear he didn't put on
4. Scorch marks from a fire that didn't happen
5. Mrs. Hedgehog thanking us for helping her garden when we didn't
6. It smells like jellybeans and... possibly disco?"

"Don't forget number seven," Papa added, pointing at the doormat. "Our welcome mat now says 'GOODBYE' instead of 'WELCOME.'"

Everyone turned to look. Sure enough, the mat had somehow been flipped around to show its reverse side, which had 'GOODBYE' stitched on it in cheerful letters.

"Why would anyone make a doormat that says goodbye?" Mama wondered.

"WHY IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING?" Nutty practically shouted, his tail puffing up with confusion and excitement. "This is the weirdest Tuesday ever!"

"Maybe," Papa suggested thoughtfully, "we should try to figure out what's going on?"

"OBVIOUSLY," Mama and Nutty said in unison.

"But how do we investigate something when we don't know what we're investigating?" Nutty mused, tapping his pencil against his notebook.

Before anyone could answer, there was another knock at the door. This time it was Tony the Delivery Fox, holding a large pizza box.

"Here's your pizza!" he said cheerfully.

"But we didn't order—" Mama started to say.

"—a pizza yet!" Nutty finished, looking at the clock. It was 8:15 in the morning. "We were just about to make breakfast!"

"Weren't you?" Tony looked confused. He checked his delivery slip. "It says right here, one large pizza with extra cheese and pineapple, ordered by the Nutwobble family for 8:15 AM."

"But we haven't ordered anything!" Papa protested.

Tony shrugged and handed them the pizza. "Well, enjoy! It's already paid for." He walked away whistling backwards. Wait, no—he was walking backwards while whistling normally? Or was he walking normally while whistling backwards?

Nutty's brain hurt trying to figure it out.

They opened the pizza box. Inside was indeed a large pizza with extra cheese and pineapple, still hot and delicious-looking.

"I mean," Papa said, "it WOULD be rude to waste food..."

Five minutes later, while munching on morning pizza (which was surprisingly good), Nutty had an idea.

"What if," he said with a mouthful of pineapple, "everything is happening... backwards?"

"Backwards?" Mama raised an eyebrow.

"Think about it! We got thank-you notes for things we haven't done yet. The pizza arrived before we ordered it. Papa's wearing safety gear for an accident that hasn't happened. The scorch marks are there but nothing's burned. Mrs. Hedgehog thanked us for helping her garden yesterday, but from our perspective, we haven't done it yet!"

Mama and Papa looked at each other, then at Nutty, then at the pizza, then at the trophy.

"So you're saying," Papa said slowly, "that effects are happening before causes?"

"EXACTLY!" Nutty jumped up so excitedly that he nearly knocked over his orange juice. Which tipped, started to spill, then somehow unspilled itself back into the glass.

All three squirrels stared at the glass.

"Did that just..." Mama whispered.

"Yep," Nutty confirmed.

"So what do we do?" Papa asked.

Nutty grinned his most mischievous grin. "We do what we always do when weird things happen! We investigate! And probably build something ridiculous! And maybe accidentally save the day!"

"In that order?" Mama asked.

"Who knows?!" Nutty laughed. "If time is backwards, maybe we save the day first and THEN build something!"

As if to confirm his theory, a delivery truck pulled up outside with a large crate addressed to: "The Nutwobble Family - For Your Heroic Investigation - From Your Future/Past Selves."

"This," Papa declared, putting on his mysterious helmet and goggles that he definitely didn't remember putting on earlier, "is going to be the weirdest Tuesday ever."

"Or," Nutty corrected with a twinkle in his eye, "the most AMAZINGLY CONFUSING adventure we've ever had!"

They opened the crate. Inside were what appeared to be random parts for... something. Rubber bands, alarm clocks, a disco ball, several bags of jellybeans, a bicycle wheel, and six bottles of the fizziest cola Nutville had ever produced.

And right on top was a note in Nutty's own handwriting that said: "Don't worry, this will all make sense eventually. Or has it already made sense? Time is confusing. - Future/Past Nutty"

"Well then," Mama said, rolling up her sleeves. "I guess we'd better figure out what we're building!"

"Or what we've already built?" Papa suggested.

"Or what we're going to have built?" Nutty added.

"Let's just call it 'Operation Confusing Tuesday' and get started!" Mama declared.

And so began the most bewildering, backwards, and completely bonkers adventure the Silly Squirrels had ever not-yet-but-also-already experienced.
