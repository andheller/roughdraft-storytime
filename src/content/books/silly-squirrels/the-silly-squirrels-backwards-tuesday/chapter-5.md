# The Most Explosive, Backwards, Forwards, Sideways, Inside-Out Conclusion Ever

KABOOM!

Except it wasn't just KABOOM.

It was KABOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM-fizz-fizz-SPARKLE-whoosh-DING-DONG-splash-GLITTER-honk-RAINBOW-backwards-forwards-SIDEWAYS-mooooo-BOOM!

(Yes, there was a cow sound. No one knew why. The cow didn't even know why.)

The Backwards-Time Temporal Displacement Device (Bob) exploded in the most spectacular, ridiculous, magnificent, absurd, glorious, confusing explosion that had ever happened, was currently happening, and would eventually happen all at the same time.

The fizzy cola fountained in every direction at once, creating a carbonated rain that fell up, down, and in several directions that would make mathematicians cry. The jellybeans shot into the air like tiny, delicious fireworks, each one exploding into a different flavor and color. The disco ball shattered into a million sparkles, and each sparkle played a different disco song from a different era.

The rubber bands snapped and created a sound like a giant backwards orchestra tuning up while also performing a finale. The alarm clocks all rang at once, creating a time-sound so profound that for a brief moment, everyone could hear what Tuesday tasted like (it tasted like pineapple pizza, surprisingly).

The bicycle wheel spun so fast it became a portal to another dimension where bicycles ruled the world and squirrels rode them to work (which actually looked pretty fun, honestly).

And in the center of it all, the Nutwobble family stood, covered head to tail in fizzy cola, jellybeans stuck in their fur, glitter raining down on them like the world's most fabulous disaster.

"THAT," Nutty shouted over the sound of reality still deciding what it was doing, "WAS AMAZING!"

As the sparkling cola-rain settled, something incredible happened.

Well, several incredible things happened:

First, time didn't go back to normal. Instead, it decided to compromise. Some of Nutville was still running backwards. Some was running forwards. Mr. Rabbit's house was now existing in all time periods simultaneously—it was brand new, falling apart, and perfectly middle-aged all at once. The birds decided they liked flying backwards and kept doing it. Several trees were now growing in reverse but also forward, creating a sort of time-tree that shed leaves and grew them back in the same moment.

Second, a journal DID appear in Papa's pocket, just like in Nutty's vision, except when he opened it, it was written in crayon, in what appeared to be future-past-Nutty's handwriting, but the text was just drawings of disco balls and happy faces with a note that said:

"Dear Past-Future Family,

Remember yesterday when we thought Tuesday was boring and we decided to build a Boredom-Be-Gone Machine to make everything more interesting? Well, it worked! Maybe TOO well! The machine ran so well that it created a time loop where we experienced everything backwards first before experiencing it forwards! Then it exploded! Spectacularly!

But here's the thing: the explosion didn't BREAK anything. It just made everything EXTRA silly forever! Or temporarily! Or backwards-temporarily which is forwards-forever!

Anyway, don't worry about fixing it. Some things are more fun when they're broken!

Love, Yesterday-Tomorrow Nutty

P.S. - The cow sound was from Mrs. Mooington's barn. Her cows learned to time-travel. She's very proud.

P.P.S. - The disco ball says hi and it's sorry for nothing!"

"So wait," Mama said, squeezing fizzy cola out of her tail, "we built a machine YESTERDAY to make Tuesday less boring, and it worked so well that we experienced today BACKWARDS first?"

"Which means," Papa continued, pulling a jellybean out of his ear, "all the thank-you notes and trophies were from YESTERDAY'S tomorrow, which was TODAY'S yesterday, which was... wait, I confused myself."

"And the explosion," Nutty finished, grinning despite being covered in various temporal debris, "was just the machine running out of power and settling into a NEW normal where some things are backwards, some are forwards, and some are just silly!"

They looked around Nutville. It was true—nothing had gone back to "normal" normal. It had gone to "silly" normal.

Mrs. Hedgehog was happily tending her garden, which was now growing backwards and forwards vegetables. She seemed delighted that her carrots could be planted AND harvested at the same time.

Tony the Delivery Fox was making deliveries using a combination of forward and backward walking, which somehow made him twice as efficient. He was whistling a tune that hadn't been written yet.

Mr. Rabbit had gotten used to his omnitemporally-phased house and had started renting out rooms to time travelers. (There weren't any time travelers yet, but he was getting applications from himself from next week, so business was looking good.)

The birds had formed a synchronized backwards-flying team and were performing shows every afternoon (or morning, depending on which direction you were experiencing time).

"So," Mama said, looking at her cola-soaked family, "we didn't fix anything. We just... made it differently broken?"

"EXACTLY!" Nutty cheered. "Sometimes the best solution isn't to fix the problem—it's to make the problem SO silly that it becomes fun!"

"That's terrible advice," Mama pointed out.

"But it WORKED!" Papa laughed, doing a little dance that he did both forwards and backwards simultaneously.

Mayor Buttersworth appeared, walking up their path (backwards, naturally, since it seemed to be his new preferred method of locomotion).

"Nutwobble family!" he declared, still walking backwards but somehow facing forward. "I hereby present you with the official Nutville Medal of Temporal Silliness for successfully making Tuesday the most interesting day of the week! Also for that explosion! It was visible from the next town over! Very impressive!"

He handed them three medals. The medals were somehow both gold and silver, depending on which angle you looked at them, and which direction through time you were looking.

"We accept these medals with honor!" Nutty said proudly.

"And confusion!" Papa added.

"And the acknowledgment that we still don't fully understand what happened!" Mama finished.

"That's the spirit!" the Mayor beamed. "Confusion is next to cleanliness! Or is it next to godliness? I always forget. Especially now that I experience memories in alphabetical order!"

As the Mayor walked away (backwards), a piece of paper fluttered down from the sky. It landed in Nutty's hands. It was a certificate that read:

"OFFICIAL SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY CERTIFICATE

This certifies that the Nutwobble Family has discovered:
- Backwards Time (Kind of)
- Forwards Time (Also kind of)
- Sideways Time (Definitely)
- That disco balls can talk if you believe in them
- That jellybeans make excellent temporal calibration devices
- That fizzy cola should never be trusted with important scientific equipment
- That some Tuesdays are better when they're absolutely ridiculous

Signed,
The Department of Temporal Affairs That May Or May Not Exist Depending On When You're Reading This"

Nutty carefully folded the certificate and put it in his notebook, next to his notes about the adventure that they'd experienced backwards before experiencing it forwards.

"So what do we do now?" Papa asked.

Nutty looked at his family, covered in cola and glitter, standing in a backyard with scorch marks from an explosion that happened before it happened, in a town where time was now permanently silly.

"I think," Nutty said with the biggest grin, "we have dessert before dinner."

"That's backwards!" Mama protested.

"EXACTLY!" both Nutty and Papa said together.

And so the Nutwobble family went inside their house (which was now occasionally existing five minutes in the past, but they'd learned to work around it) and had ice cream sundaes for lunch, breakfast for dinner, and dinner for tomorrow's yesterday.

Outside, Nutville continued being wonderfully, absurdly, magnificently silly. Clocks ran in whatever direction they felt like. Birds flew backwards. Houses existed in multiple time periods. And every Tuesday from then on was guaranteed to be interesting, because time itself had learned that sometimes being silly is better than being sensible.

As for the Backwards-Time Temporal Displacement Device (Bob), its pieces were scattered across the backyard, sparkling with residual temporal energy. The disco ball's sparkles had embedded themselves in the grass and now, whenever the sun hit them just right, you could hear faint disco music and smell jellybeans.

"You know," Mama said, eating her pre-dinner dessert, "this might be our silliest adventure yet."

"Our silliest adventure SO FAR," Nutty corrected with a wink. "Who knows what we'll do tomorrow?"

"Or yesterday!" Papa added cheerfully.

"Or sideways!" they all said together, because at this point, why not?

And if you visited Nutville today (or yesterday, or tomorrow, depending on which direction you were traveling through time), you'd still find it just as silly. You'd still see the Nutwobble family having adventures, building ridiculous machines, and generally making life more interesting.

Because sometimes the best solution to a boring Tuesday isn't to make it normal.

Sometimes the best solution is to make it so explosively, magnificently, ridiculously SILLY that even time itself doesn't know what to do except join in the fun.

And honestly? That's way better than normal anyway.

**THE END**

*(Or the beginning? Or the middle? Time is complicated. But at least it's never boring!)*

**EPILOGUE (Which Happens Before The Story But Also After It):**

Three months later (or earlier, or sideways), Nutty found one more note in his notebook. It was from Future-Future-Nutty, written in neat handwriting:

"Dear Past-Me,

Thanks for not fixing the time thing. Nutville is way more fun this way. Also, Mrs. Mooington's time-traveling cows started a delivery service that delivers milk before you order it, which is surprisingly convenient.

By the way, you're going to find this note tomorrow, even though I wrote it yesterday, which is actually next week from your perspective. Time is weird!

Keep being silly!

Love, Several-Times-Future You

P.S. - The disco ball became mayor. Don't ask. It's a long story. Or a short story. Or a sideways story. You'll see. Or you already did. Or you will have seen it. Ugh, time grammar is STILL confusing!"

Nutty smiled, closed his notebook, and looked out the window where a disco ball was indeed running for mayor on a platform of "More Sparkle, More Disco, More Backwards Flying Birds."

"Best. Tuesday. Ever," he whispered.

And somewhere in time (all of the times, really), Tuesday agreed.
