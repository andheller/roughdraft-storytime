# The Pizza Problem

It was a perfectly ordinary Tuesday morning in Nutville when Nutty discovered the town's biggest problem. He was perched on his favorite branch, watching Mrs. Hedgehog waiting by her front door, tapping her foot impatiently.

"Where's my pizza?" she called out to no one in particular. "I ordered it an hour ago!"

Down the street, Mr. Rabbit was pacing back and forth on his porch. "My pizza's probably cold by now," he grumbled.

Nutty's ears perked up. He scampered down to investigate, his bushy tail twitching with curiosity.

"What's taking so long?" he asked Tony the Delivery Fox, who was huffing and puffing as he trudged up the hill with a stack of pizza boxes.

"*Wheeze*... The hills... *puff*... are too steep," Tony gasped. "And there are too many orders! By the time I walk to the far side of town, the pizza is stone cold!"

Nutty scratched his furry chin thoughtfully. This was clearly a job for the Silly Squirrels! But how could they deliver pizza faster than Tony?

He raced back to the old oak tree where Mama and Papa Nutwobble were practicing their acrobatic moves.

"Mama! Papa! I've got it!" Nutty announced, doing a dramatic backflip off a low branch. "We need to start a pizza delivery service!"

Papa Nutwobble paused mid-leap between two branches. "But Nutty, we don't have a pizza truck. Or even bicycles!"

"Who needs trucks when you can FLY?" Nutty exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with mischief.

Mama Nutwobble nearly fell out of the tree. "Fly? Nutty, squirrels can glide, but we can't actually fly!"

"Not yet we can't," Nutty grinned, pulling out a crumpled magazine he'd found in someone's recycling bin. On the cover was a picture of a person wearing a jetpack, zooming through the sky. "But what if we could build our own jetpacks?"

Mama and Papa looked at each other, then at Nutty, then at the magazine.

"That's..." Mama began.

"Completely ridiculous," Papa finished.

"EXACTLY!" Nutty shouted with glee. "The more ridiculous, the more fun! Plus, think about it - we could deliver hot pizza to anywhere in Nutville in under five minutes!"

The three family members stared at the magazine cover, imagining themselves zooming through the sky with pizza boxes strapped to their backs.

"Well," Papa said slowly, "it would certainly solve Tony's problem..."

"And we'd be heroes!" Mama added, getting caught up in the excitement.

"Then it's settled!" Nutty declared. "Tomorrow, we build jetpacks! The Silly Squirrels Pizza Jetpack Delivery Service is officially open for business!"

As the sun set over Nutville, three very excited squirrels began planning the most wonderfully ridiculous adventure of their lives.
