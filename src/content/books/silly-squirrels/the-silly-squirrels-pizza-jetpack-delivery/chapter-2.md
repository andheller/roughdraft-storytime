# Building Bottle Jetpacks

The next morning, Nutty woke up with fizzy soda bottles dancing in his head. He'd spent all night dreaming about jetpacks and had the perfect plan!

He scampered to the town recycling center, where mountains of empty soda bottles sparkled in the morning sun. "Perfect!" he squeaked, stuffing his cheeks with as many bottles as they could hold.

By the time Mama and Papa Nutwobble arrived at their workshop (which was really just a clearing behind the oak tree), Nutty had already sorted the bottles by size and color.

"Okay, here's the plan," Nutty announced, wearing a colander on his head like a helmet. "We strap these big bottles to our backs, fill them with... um..." He paused. "What makes jetpacks work again?"

"Rocket fuel?" Chip suggested.

"We don't have rocket fuel," Mama pointed out.

"Baking soda and vinegar!" Nutty exclaimed. "My cousin tried it in a science experiment once. Made a huge mess!"

Within an hour, they had the most ridiculous-looking jetpacks ever created. Papa's was made from bright orange soda bottles held together with jump ropes. Mama's was a collection of green bottles that rattled when she moved. Nutty's was the most ambitious - a cluster of different colored bottles that looked like a rainbow explosion.

But the best part was their helmets. Since regular helmets were boring, they'd raided the town's lost-and-found box. Papa wore a bright yellow rain hat with a plastic duck on top. Mama had found a fuzzy winter hat with enormous ear flaps that made her look like a flying sheep. Nutty's colander was decorated with dangling bottle caps that clinked together when he moved.

"We look absolutely ridiculous," Mama said, catching her reflection in a puddle.

"Mission accomplished!" Nutty grinned.

They spent the morning mixing baking soda and vinegar in their bottle chambers, which resulted in lots of fizzing, several small explosions, and Papa getting completely soaked when his safety cork popped out.

"Maybe we need less vinegar?" Papa suggested, wringing out his tail.

"Or more baking soda!" Nutty added more powder to his bottles, which immediately started bubbling over.

After three hours of tinkering, adjustments, and one incident where Mama's ear flaps got tangled in her jetpack straps, they were finally ready for the first test flight.

"Who goes first?" Papa asked nervously.

"I will!" Nutty declared, striking a superhero pose. "For pizza!"

He pressed the big red button he'd made from a bottle cap. His jetpack sputtered, wheezed, made a sound like a deflating balloon, and then...

*WHOOOOSH!*

Nutty shot three feet into the air, spun in a circle, and landed bottom-first in Mrs. Owl's birdbath with a tremendous splash.

"IT WORKS!" he shouted triumphantly, water dripping from his colander. "Sort of!"
