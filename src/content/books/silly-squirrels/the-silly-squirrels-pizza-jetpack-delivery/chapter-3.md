# Crash Landing Chronicles

"Alright, everyone!" Nutty announced the next morning, still picking birdbath algae out of his fur. "Today we make our first official pizza delivery!"

Tony the Fox had agreed to let them try delivering one pizza - just one - to Mrs. Badger who lived on the other side of Nutville. 

"If you can get this pizza there hot and in one piece," Tony said, handing them a steaming pepperoni pizza, "I'll give you more deliveries."

Nutty strapped the pizza box to his back with a bungee cord, adjusted his colander helmet, and prepared for takeoff. Mama and Papa put on their goofy hats and got ready to follow.

"Pizza delivery squad, ready for launch!" Nutty called out.

*WHOOOOSH!*

His jetpack fired up beautifully. He soared into the sky, pizza box secured, feeling like the greatest flying squirrel who ever lived. For exactly four seconds.

Then he realized he had no idea how to steer.

"INCOMING LAUNDRY!" he yelled as he zoomed straight toward Mrs. Raccoon's clothesline. He spun sideways, crashed through a sheet, got tangled in pajamas, and pinballed between three different t-shirts before finally breaking free.

The pizza box was now decorated with a sock.

Meanwhile, Papa had figured out steering but not altitude control. His jetpack kept cutting out, causing him to hop through the air like a very confused kangaroo.

*Whoosh* - up ten feet.
*Sputter* - down five feet.
*WHOOSH* - up fifteen feet.
*Pop* - straight down into Mr. Possum's garbage cans.

Mama was having the opposite problem. Her jetpack worked perfectly, but her enormous ear flaps kept blocking her vision. She flew in a completely straight line - which would have been fine if there weren't any trees, telephone poles, or extremely surprised birds in her way.

"DUCK!" she called out, though it was unclear if she was warning the duck or asking it to move.

After twenty minutes of aerial chaos, the three family members crash-landed in Mrs. Badger's rose garden, covered in leaves, wearing various pieces of laundry, and looking like they'd been through a blender.

Mrs. Badger opened her door and stared at them. "Are you my pizza delivery?"

"Yes!" Nutty gasped, untangling the pizza box from a rosebush. "One pepperoni pizza, delivered by... uh..." He looked at their ridiculous state. "Premium air express?"

Mrs. Badger opened the box. The pizza had somehow stayed perfectly intact, though it now had a decorative pattern of rose petals on top.

"Well," she said slowly, "it's still hot. And those rose petals actually smell quite nice." She handed Nutty a tip. "Same time tomorrow?"

The three family members looked at each other with pizza sauce in their fur and determination in their eyes.

"Absolutely!" they said in unison.
