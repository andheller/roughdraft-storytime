# Water Gun Wake-Up Calls

By the end of the week, the Silly Squirrels Pizza Jetpack Delivery Service had become famous throughout Nutville - mostly for their spectacular crashes. But they were getting orders!

The biggest problem was that flying made them incredibly sleepy. All the swooshing and zooming and crash-landing was exhausting.

"We need a better system," Nutty yawned, nearly dozing off while strapped into his jetpack. "Yesterday I fell asleep mid-flight and woke up hanging upside down in the town clock tower."

"I fell asleep and crashed into the fire station," Papa added. "The fire chief was not amused."

"At least you didn't fall asleep and somehow deliver pizza to yourself," Mama grumbled. "I woke up in my own tree with a mushroom pizza I don't even remember ordering."

That's when Nutty spotted them in the toy store window: three bright purple water guns, complete with shoulder straps and extra-large water tanks.

"THAT'S IT!" he shouted, pressing his face against the glass. "Emergency wake-up equipment!"

Soon, each squirrel had a water gun strapped to their chest. The plan was simple: if someone looked sleepy during flight, the others would give them a refreshing wake-up splash.

Their first test came during a delivery to the lighthouse keeper on the far side of town. Halfway there, Papa started yawning and his flying became wobbly.

"Papa's getting drowsy!" Mama called out. "Initiating wake-up protocol!"

*SQUIRT!*

She fired a stream of cold water right at Papa's face. He jerked awake instantly, but the surprise made him accidentally trigger his jetpack at full blast.

"WHOA!" Papa rocketed forward like a furry missile, pizza boxes trailing behind him.

"Get him!" Nutty shouted, giving chase. But flying at top speed while carrying water guns and wearing a colander helmet was trickier than expected.

What followed was the most ridiculous high-speed chase Nutville had ever seen. Papa zoomed between buildings with his duck hat flapping wildly. Nutty and Mama pursued him, squirting water guns and shouting helpful suggestions like "TURN LEFT!" and "WATCH OUT FOR THAT PIGEON!"

They finally caught up to Papa when he ran out of jetpack fuel and glided into the town fountain with a tremendous splash.

"Well," said the lighthouse keeper, who had witnessed the entire chase from his tower, "that was certainly entertaining. Is my pizza okay?"

They checked the boxes. Somehow, miraculously, all three pizzas were perfectly fine, though slightly damp.

"You know what?" the lighthouse keeper chuckled, "I think I'll order from you again tomorrow. But maybe include a towel with the delivery?"

That night, as they cleaned their water guns and hung up their ridiculous helmets, the three family members couldn't stop grinning.

"Tomorrow," Nutty declared, "we're going to be the best pizza delivery squirrels in the history of pizza delivery squirrels!"

"Even if we're also the wettest," Papa added, wringing water out of his tail.

"And the most ridiculous," Mama finished, adjusting her sheep-ear hat.

"Especially the most ridiculous," they all agreed.
