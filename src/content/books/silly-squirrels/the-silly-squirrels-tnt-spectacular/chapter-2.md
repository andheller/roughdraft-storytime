# Two Million Sticks of TNT

The next morning, Nutty woke up so early that even the early birds were still hitting the snooze button. He scrambled out of bed, tripped over his tail twice (a new record), and bounded down to the kitchen where Mama and Papa were already making breakfast.

"Ready for Operation Spectacular Celebration?" Nutty asked, striking a heroic pose that would have been more impressive if he wasn't wearing his acorn-patterned pajamas.

"I made a safety checklist!" Mama announced, holding up a clipboard with at least forty-seven items listed. "Including 'Don't accidentally blow up Nutville,' which I've underlined three times."

"And I brought my special TNT-handling gloves!" Papa added, pulling out a pair of enormous, puffy oven mitts covered in little smiley faces. "I figure if they can handle Mama's extra-spicy chili, they can handle anything explosive!"

After a breakfast of acorn pancakes (which Nutty ate in approximately twelve seconds), the three Nutwobbles headed to Uncle Boom-Boom's Construction Depot on the edge of town.

Uncle Boom-Boom was the biggest, fluffiest squirrel in Nutville, with a hard hat that had "BOOM" written on one side and "BOOM" written on the other side, just in case you forgot what his specialty was.

"Well, well, well!" Uncle Boom-Boom boomed (naturally). "If it isn't my favorite little explosion enthusiast! I heard you want to borrow my TNT for Nutville's celebration!"

"Two million sticks, please!" Nutty said cheerfully.

Uncle Boom-Boom laughed so hard his hard hat fell off. "You know, when you said that on the phone, I thought you were joking! But then I remembered you're the squirrel who built a working submarine out of a pickle barrel, so..." He gestured toward the warehouse. "Right this way!"

The warehouse doors creaked open, and Nutty's jaw dropped so low it nearly hit the ground.

Sticks of TNT. EVERYWHERE.

They were stacked in neat rows that stretched from one end of the massive warehouse to the other, piled up twenty sticks high, arranged in perfect grid patterns. Each stick had a little label that read "HANDLE WITH CARE - ALSO, DON'T DROP THIS."

"Two million, three hundred and forty-two sticks, to be exact," Uncle Boom-Boom said proudly. "I was going to demolish the old Acorn Factory downtown, but they decided to turn it into a museum instead. So now I've got all this TNT just sitting here, getting bored."

"Can TNT get bored?" Papa whispered to Mama.

"Let's not find out," Mama whispered back.

"Now," Uncle Boom-Boom pulled out a huge manual that was so thick it could double as a doorstop, "before I let you borrow these, we need to go over the Safety Protocols, Emergency Procedures, and the Very Important List of Things You Should Definitely Never Ever Do."

For the next hour, Uncle Boom-Boom taught them everything about handling TNT safely:

- Always carry it gently (like it's a sleeping baby, but more explosive)
- Keep it far away from fire, sparks, or Papa's bad jokes (which could be considered inflammatory)
- Set up in an open area at least half a mile from any buildings
- Use electronic timers with multiple backup systems
- Have a master control panel with a big red STOP button
- And most importantly: "If anything starts to go wrong, RUN AWAY VERY FAST and then RUN AWAY SOME MORE."

"This is SO professional!" Nutty said, taking notes in his notebook with a pencil that had a little eraser shaped like a mushroom cloud.

Uncle Boom-Boom also provided them with:
- One industrial-strength electronic control panel (with the biggest, reddest STOP button ever made)
- Twelve miles of safety wire (the special kind that doesn't accidentally blow things up)
- Five thousand electronic detonators (the fancy ones with digital timers)
- Seventy bags of colored powder (red, blue, green, purple, orange, pink, and "mystery color")
- Three hard hats (one with a built-in flashlight, one with a lucky rabbit's foot, and one that played safety announcements in a very serious robot voice)
- And one HUGE truck to transport everything

"Now remember," Uncle Boom-Boom said seriously, adjusting his own hard hat, "TNT is not a toy. It's a tool. A very, VERY boom-y tool. I need you to promise me you'll follow every single safety rule."

"We promise!" all three Nutwobbles said together, placing their paws over their hearts.

"And if ANYTHING seems wrong—ANYTHING at all—you hit that STOP button and call me immediately. I'll be on standby with the fire department, just in case."

"Just in case of what?" Papa asked nervously.

"Just in case of just in case," Uncle Boom-Boom said wisely.

With Uncle Boom-Boom's help (and a really big forklift), they loaded the TNT onto the massive truck. It took three hours and two snack breaks, but finally, all two million, three hundred and forty-two sticks of TNT were loaded up.

"Where should we set up?" Mama asked, looking at a map of Nutville.

Nutty pointed to a spot on the map labeled "Big Empty Field That Nobody Uses For Anything." It was exactly half a mile outside of town, completely flat, and had nothing around it except grass, sky, and a really confused cow that wandered by sometimes.

"Perfect!" Papa agreed. "Plenty of space, no trees to accidentally explode, and excellent viewing distance from the town square!"

As they drove the massive truck toward the Big Empty Field (going exactly the speed limit, because safety first!), Nutty couldn't stop grinning.

"This is going to be the most spectacular fireworks show in the history of everything!" he declared.

"What patterns should we make?" Mama asked, getting excited despite her safety concerns. "We could do stars, hearts, the Nutville town logo—"

"How about a giant acorn?" Papa suggested. "Or no, wait—a SMILEY FACE made of explosions!"

"We could spell out 'HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY NUTVILLE' in TNT!" Nutty added, bouncing in his seat.

The three family members spent the rest of the drive planning the most elaborate, spectacular, absolutely ridiculous fireworks display ever conceived by squirrel-kind.

When they arrived at the Big Empty Field, Papa parked the truck and they all stood looking out at the huge, empty space.

"Okay team," Mama said, putting on her hard hat (the one with the lucky rabbit's foot). "Let's set up the most amazing celebration Nutville has ever seen!"

"Safety first!" Papa added, adjusting his hard hat (the one with the serious robot voice, which immediately said "PLEASE WORK RESPONSIBLY").

"And boom second!" Nutty finished, his hard hat's flashlight accidentally turning on and shining directly in his eyes. "Ow! I mean, yes, boom second, after I can see again!"

As the sun climbed higher in the sky, three determined squirrels began unloading two million sticks of TNT, ready to create the celebration of the century.

What could possibly go wrong?

(Spoiler alert: Several things. But we'll get to that later.)
