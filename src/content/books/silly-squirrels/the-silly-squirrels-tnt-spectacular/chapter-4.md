# The Big Boom

The day of Nutville's 100th anniversary celebration arrived with perfect weather—blue sky, gentle breeze, and not a rain cloud in sight. The entire town gathered in the town square, which had been decorated with streamers, balloons, and a giant banner that read "HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY, NUTVILLE!"

Mayor Oakwood stood on the stage, adjusting his glasses and looking very official in his special mayoral sash that he only wore on important occasions.

"Citizens of Nutville!" he announced through a microphone that made his voice echo across the square. "Welcome to our 100th anniversary celebration! We have cake, we have music, we have speeches about the history of Nutville—"

"GET TO THE GOOD PART!" someone yelled from the crowd. It might have been Mr. Rabbit.

"And," Mayor Oakwood continued with a smile, "thanks to the Nutwobble family, we have a VERY special fireworks show planned for eight o'clock!"

The crowd cheered! Everyone had heard rumors about the Silly Squirrels' latest project, but nobody knew exactly what they'd planned.

Meanwhile, half a mile away at the Big Empty Field, Mama, Papa, and Nutty were doing their final pre-show checks.

"Control panel power: CHECK!" Nutty called out, reading from his clipboard.

"All wires connected: CHECK!" Mama added, testing the connections one more time.

"Emergency stop buttons working: CHECK! Also, I'm still slightly purple: ALSO CHECK!" Papa announced, still showing faint traces of yesterday's powder incident.

Uncle Boom-Boom was there too, along with the entire Nutville Volunteer Fire Department (just in case of just in case), all standing at a safe distance with binoculars.

"Remember," Uncle Boom-Boom said seriously, "the show is designed to last exactly five minutes. It'll spell out 'HAPPY 100TH,' show the giant birthday cake, and finish with a spectacular finale. Stay here at the control panel, watch your timer, and if ANYTHING seems wrong—"

"Hit the STOP button!" the three Nutwobbles recited together.

The sun began to set, painting the sky in beautiful shades of orange and pink. In the town square, everyone was finishing their cake and gathering to watch the show. Mrs. Hedgehog had brought lawn chairs. Mr. Rabbit had binoculars. Tony the Delivery Fox had invited his entire extended family.

At 7:55 PM, Nutty looked at the control panel clock.

"Five minutes to showtime!" he announced, his paws trembling with excitement.

"I can't believe we pulled this off!" Mama said, grinning from ear to ear.

"This is going to be LEGENDARY!" Papa added, putting on his earplugs (the fancy kind that made everyone's voices sound like cartoon chipmunks).

At 7:59 PM and 00 seconds, Nutty placed his paw on the activation button.

"Here we go!" he said, taking a deep breath. "Starting countdown in three... two... one..."

He pressed the button.

"BEEP! COUNTDOWN INITIATED. T-MINUS SIXTY SECONDS," announced the control panel in a calm, professional robot voice.

In the town square, Mayor Oakwood raised his arms. "Citizens of Nutville, please direct your attention to the Big Empty Field for the most spectacular celebration in our town's history!"

Everyone turned to look toward the field.

Back at the control panel, everything was going perfectly.

T-minus 50 seconds...
T-minus 40 seconds...
T-minus 30 seconds...

"This is it!" Nutty whispered, squeezing his clipboard so hard it started to creak.

T-minus 20 seconds...

And that's when they noticed something.

The countdown was speeding up.

"Um," Mama said, pointing at the control panel. "Is it supposed to do that?"

The display, which had been counting down normally, suddenly started going faster:

T-minus 15 seconds...
T-minus 12 seconds...
T-minus 9 seconds...

"THAT'S NOT NORMAL!" Nutty yelped, frantically checking the wires.

"WHY IS IT GOING FASTER?!" Papa shouted, his voice sounding extra squeaky through the earplugs.

T-minus 5 seconds...
T-minus 3 seconds...
T-minus 1 second...

"EVERYONE GET DOWN!" Uncle Boom-Boom yelled.

T-minus ZERO.

**BOOM!**

The first explosion went off perfectly—a beautiful red burst that lit up the darkening sky.

But then the second explosion went off.

And the third.

And the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth...

"IT'S GOING TOO FAST!" Nutty screamed over the noise.

The carefully planned five-minute show was now happening in what appeared to be about thirty seconds. The TNT that was supposed to spell out "HAPPY 100TH" was exploding so fast it looked like someone was scribbling in the sky with sparklers while riding a very fast rollercoaster.

**BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!**

"HIT THE STOP BUTTON!" Uncle Boom-Boom shouted.

Mama lunged for the nearest red STOP button and slammed her paw down on it.

Nothing happened. The explosions continued.

Papa hit the second STOP button. Nothing.

Nutty hit the third STOP button. Still nothing!

"THE STOP BUTTONS AREN'T WORKING!" Nutty yelled, his eyes wide as dinner plates.

In the town square, everyone was staring in absolute shock as the sky erupted in the most chaotic, ridiculous, spectacular display of explosions anyone had ever seen. It wasn't spelling out words anymore—it was just pure, colorful, absolutely bonkers BOOM.

The "birthday cake" section of the display went off all at once, creating what looked like a giant mushroom cloud made of rainbows.

"WHAT'S HAPPENING?!" Mayor Oakwood shouted, though he couldn't look away.

"IT'S BEAUTIFUL!" Mrs. Hedgehog yelled back, her eyes reflecting the colorful explosions.

"IT'S TERRIFYING!" Mr. Rabbit added.

"IT'S BOTH!" Tony the Fox concluded.

Back at the control panel, Nutty was frantically reading the manual while explosions continued in the background.

"HERE!" he shouted, pointing at a page. "It says if the stop buttons fail, there's a MASTER EMERGENCY CUTOFF SWITCH under the panel!"

All three Nutwobbles dove under the control panel, searching frantically while the explosions continued to light up the sky like the world's most aggressive disco party.

"I FOUND IT!" Mama yelled, pulling a bright yellow handle.

Nothing happened.

"THAT'S THE SNACK COMPARTMENT!" Papa pointed out, as a bag of emergency trail mix fell out.

"HERE'S THE REAL ONE!" Nutty grabbed a red lever marked "ULTIMATE EMERGENCY STOP - BREAK GLASS IN CASE OF TOO MUCH BOOM."

He yanked the lever.

There was a loud "CLUNK" sound.

And then... the explosions kept going.

"WHY ISN'T IT STOPPING?!" all three Nutwobbles screamed together.

Uncle Boom-Boom was reading the manual over their shoulders, his flashlight bouncing around as more explosions lit up the sky. "Oh no," he said, his voice barely audible over the BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. "Oh no no no."

"WHAT?!" Nutty asked.

"The emergency stop only works if the detonation sequence hasn't entered the final cascade phase!" Uncle Boom-Boom read from the manual. "Once it starts, it has to finish on its own!"

"SO WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT?!" Mama asked.

"WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT!" Uncle Boom-Boom confirmed.

The explosions continued for exactly four more minutes and thirty seconds (which, when you're watching two million sticks of TNT explode faster than planned, feels like approximately seventeen years).

The colored powder created clouds of red, blue, green, purple, orange, pink, and "mystery color" (which turned out to be a sort of sparkly teal that nobody had ordered but looked pretty cool anyway).

The sound was SO LOUD that every car alarm in Nutville started going off in harmony.

Every dog started howling.

Every cat climbed to the highest point they could find and made very judgmental faces.

The confused cow, who had wandered back to watch the show, let out one long "MOOOOOOO" that somehow lasted the entire four and a half minutes.

And then, just when everyone thought it couldn't get any more spectacular...

The finale went off.

But instead of being spread out over thirty seconds like planned, ALL of the finale explosions went off at exactly the same time.

**BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOOOOOOM!**

The explosion was so big, so colorful, so absolutely SPECTACULAR, that it created a shockwave that:

- Made every flag in Nutville wave frantically
- Blew Mayor Oakwood's toupee three feet into the air (nobody knew he wore a toupee until that moment)
- Caused Mrs. Hedgehog's lawn chairs to fold up with everyone still sitting in them
- Turned all the balloons in the town square the same direction, like they were doing a synchronized swimming routine
- And most impressively, gently lifted every single citizen of Nutville approximately two inches off the ground for exactly one second

When everyone landed back down (very gently, like the world's smallest elevator), there was complete silence.

The explosions had stopped.

The sky was filled with slowly drifting clouds of colored powder.

Every single stick of TNT had been used up.

In the Big Empty Field (which was now just the Big Slightly Charred Field), the control panel displayed one final message:

"SHOW COMPLETE. THANK YOU FOR USING BOOM-TASTIC 3000 FIREWORKS CONTROL SYSTEM. PLEASE RATE YOUR EXPERIENCE."

The five Nutwobbles (three family members plus Uncle Boom-Boom) and the entire fire department stared at the panel.

Then they stared at the sky.

Then they stared at each other.

"Well," Papa said finally, breaking the silence, "that was definitely spectacular."
