# The Boring Celebration Problem

It was a perfectly ordinary Wednesday morning in Nutville when Nutty discovered the town's biggest disappointment. He was hanging upside down from his favorite tree branch, reading the Nutville Gazette, when a headline caught his eye:

**"NUTVILLE'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION THIS SATURDAY!"**

"Wow!" Nutty squeaked excitedly. "A hundred years! That's like... a LOT of birthdays!"

He scampered down to the town square where Mayor Oakwood was putting up decorations. There were streamers, balloons, and a small stage set up for the celebration.

"This is going to be AMAZING, right Mayor?" Nutty asked, his tail swishing with anticipation.

Mayor Oakwood sighed deeply, his old oak-bark face looking particularly wrinkly with worry. "Well, Nutty, we have cake and music and speeches... but our fireworks budget got spent on fixing the town fountain after, well, your submarine incident last month."

"Oh." Nutty's ears drooped a little. "So no fireworks?"

"We have five sparklers," the Mayor said sadly, holding up a tiny box. "Mrs. Hedgehog donated them from her birthday party supplies."

"FIVE SPARKLERS?!" Nutty gasped. "For the WHOLE TOWN'S 100TH BIRTHDAY?!"

Down the street, Mr. Rabbit was testing the sparklers. He lit one, and it fizzled out after exactly three seconds, producing a sad little "pfft" sound and one tiny spark.

"Yep," Mr. Rabbit called out. "These are pretty much the most boring sparklers ever created. I've seen brighter light from a sleepy firefly with a cold."

Nutty scratched his furry chin thoughtfully. A celebration this important needed something SPECTACULAR. Something AMAZING. Something that would make everyone in Nutville talk about it for the next hundred years!

He raced back to the old oak tree where Mama and Papa Nutwobble were organizing their acorn collection by size, shape, and "deliciousness rating."

"Mama! Papa!" Nutty burst in, doing his signature triple-backflip entrance (he'd been practicing). "Nutville's 100th anniversary is this Saturday, and we only have five terrible sparklers for fireworks!"

Papa Nutwobble looked up from an acorn he was examining with a magnifying glass. "Five sparklers? That's not even one sparkler per twenty years! That's like celebrating your birthday with one-fifth of a cupcake!"

"We need to do something SPECTACULAR!" Nutty declared, pulling out a documentary DVD he'd found at the library. On the cover was a massive explosion with the title "The Science of Controlled Demolitions and Fireworks."

Mama Nutwobble's eyes widened. "Nutty, that's a documentary about blowing things up."

"Exactly!" Nutty grinned, popping the DVD into their player. "But look at this part right here!"

He fast-forwarded to a scene showing a beautiful fireworks display, with colorful explosions lighting up the night sky in perfect patterns and sequences.

"See? Fireworks are basically controlled explosions! And look at what they use—" Nutty paused the video on a frame showing workers carefully arranging equipment. "They plan everything super carefully with timers and safety measures!"

"But Nutty," Mama said slowly, "fireworks are expensive. And we already spent the town's budget on—"

"The submarine incident, I know, I know," Nutty waved his paw dismissively. "But what if we didn't use regular fireworks? What if we used something even MORE spectacular?"

Papa's tail twitched nervously. "Why do I get the feeling this is going to involve something wonderfully ridiculous?"

"Because it IS!" Nutty pulled out another page from his notebook, where he'd been sketching ideas. "Yesterday, I overheard my Uncle Boom-Boom at the construction company talking about how they have TWO MILLION sticks of TNT they need to return to the supplier because their big demolition project got cancelled!"

Mama and Papa stared at Nutty.

"Two million," Mama said slowly.

"Sticks of TNT," Papa added.

"For a FIREWORKS show," Nutty finished with jazz hands. "We'll borrow them, set them up in a safe, controlled way just like in the documentary, and create the most SPECTACULAR celebration display in the history of Nutville! Maybe even the history of ALL THE TOWNS!"

Papa Nutwobble was already doing calculations on his paw. "Two million sticks divided by... carry the one... that's a LOT of boom per square foot of town square."

"But it's CONTROLLED boom!" Nutty insisted. "Look, the documentary explains everything about safety zones, proper timing, and blast patterns! We'll be like professional pyrotechnicians!"

"Pyro-what-now?" Mama asked.

"Fireworks scientists!" Nutty translated. "We'll set everything up super safely, way outside of town, and create the most amazing light show Nutville has ever seen! We can make shapes, colors, patterns—Uncle Boom-Boom even has the colored powder stuff they use to make the explosions pretty!"

Mama Nutwobble was trying very hard to be the responsible parent. "Nutty, darling, two million sticks of TNT sounds like a lot of TNT."

"It IS a lot! That's what makes it SPECTACULAR!" Nutty's eyes were sparkling with that familiar look of absolutely ridiculous determination.

Papa looked at Mama. Mama looked at Papa. They both looked at Nutty, who was bouncing up and down with excitement.

"The Mayor DID say the celebration needed something special," Papa said thoughtfully.

"And Nutty's Uncle Boom-Boom IS a licensed demolition expert," Mama added. "He probably knows about safety."

"And we WOULD be following the documentary's instructions exactly!" Nutty said, rewinding to show them the safety checklist.

The three family members stared at the TV screen, where a professional pyrotechnician was explaining the importance of "proper planning and safety protocols."

"So," Papa said slowly, "tomorrow we become fireworks scientists?"

"Tomorrow we become the BEST fireworks scientists!" Mama agreed, her excitement starting to match Nutty's.

"And we give Nutville the most explosive 100th anniversary celebration in HISTORY!" Nutty cheered, jumping so high he bonked his head on the ceiling (but in an excited way).

As the sun set over Nutville, casting a golden glow over the five disappointing sparklers sitting in Mayor Oakwood's office, three very enthusiastic squirrels began planning what would definitely, absolutely, completely be a perfectly reasonable fireworks show.

Little did they know, "perfectly reasonable" and "two million sticks of TNT" are not phrases that usually go together.

But they were about to find out.
