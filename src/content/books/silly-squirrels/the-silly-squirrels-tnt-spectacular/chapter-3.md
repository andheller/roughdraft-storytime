# The Setup Shuffle

Setting up two million sticks of TNT, it turned out, was harder than it looked in the documentary.

A LOT harder.

"Okay," Nutty said, standing in the middle of the Big Empty Field with his clipboard and a very detailed diagram. "According to my calculations, if we arrange the TNT in the pattern I've designed, we'll create a spectacular display that spells out 'HAPPY 100TH' with a giant exploding birthday cake underneath!"

"How big of a birthday cake?" Papa asked, looking at the diagram.

"Forty feet tall!" Nutty said proudly.

"Made of TNT," Mama added, just to clarify.

"The BEST kind of birthday cake!" Nutty grinned.

They spent the first hour carefully placing sticks of TNT in precise patterns across the field. Mama, being the fastest squirrel in Nutville, was in charge of running back and forth with supplies. Papa, being the funniest, was in charge of keeping everyone's spirits up with jokes. And Nutty, being the inventor, was in charge of making sure every stick was in exactly the right spot.

"How do you organize an explosion?" Papa called out while placing a stick of TNT. "You planet!"

Mama groaned from across the field. "Papa, this is serious business!"

"You're right, I should be more careful. After all, this job is really DYNAMITE!" Papa chuckled at his own joke.

"Papa, that's not even the right kind of explosive!" Nutty pointed out.

"Are you saying my joke BOMBED?" Papa was on a roll now.

By noon, they had placed approximately thirty thousand sticks of TNT in the pattern for the letters "HAP—" but that's when things started getting complicated.

First, a strong wind came through the Big Empty Field.

"WHOOOOOOSH!"

Five hundred sticks of TNT that they hadn't secured yet started rolling around like fuzzy, explosive bowling pins.

"CATCH THEM!" Mama yelled, racing after the rolling TNT at her top speed, which was very fast but also very panicky.

"I got one! No wait, I got three! NO WAIT, THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!" Papa shouted, juggling armfuls of TNT sticks like the world's most dangerous circus act.

Nutty dove forward and managed to stop the runaway TNT by building a quick barrier out of the empty crates. "Crisis averted!" he announced, just before the confused cow that lived nearby wandered into the field.

"Moooo?" said the cow, looking at the massive field of TNT with mild interest.

"NO NO NO! Shoo! Go away! This is a no-cow zone!" Nutty waved his arms frantically.

The cow, being a cow, decided this was the perfect time to lie down for a nap. Right in the middle of where the giant "Y" in "HAPPY" was supposed to go.

"You've got to be kidding me," Mama sighed.

It took twenty minutes and three carrots (borrowed from Mr. Rabbit's garden) to convince the cow to move to a safer location. The cow left, but not before accidentally kicking over a stack of colored powder bags, covering Papa in bright purple dust.

"I'm grape squirrel now!" Papa announced, looking like a fuzzy purple cloud with eyes.

By mid-afternoon, they had successfully placed about half of the TNT. The pattern was starting to take shape—you could almost make out the words "HAPPY 100TH" if you squinted and stood on one foot and tilted your head to the left.

"Looking good, team!" Nutty said, checking his diagram. "Now we just need to connect all the electronic detonators to the control panel!"

This is where things got REALLY tricky.

They had twelve miles of wire and five thousand detonators to connect. Each wire had to go to exactly the right stick of TNT, in exactly the right order, so the explosions would happen in the perfect sequence to create the spectacular display.

"Okay, wire number one connects to detonator number one," Nutty read from his instructions, "which connects to TNT group A-1, which will explode at T-minus-zero-point-five-seconds..."

"This is more complicated than Mama's recipe for seven-layer acorn casserole," Papa observed, carefully attaching a wire to a detonator.

"And I've never successfully made that without something catching on fire," Mama admitted, working on her section of wires.

They worked steadily for hours, connecting wires and detonators with the careful precision of squirrels who really, REALLY didn't want to accidentally blow anything up early.

At one point, Nutty sneezed.

"ACHOO!"

The sneeze was so powerful that it blew three wires loose, tangled Papa's tail in a spool of wire, and knocked over Nutty's clipboard, which landed on a button on the control panel.

"BEEP!" said the control panel cheerfully.

Everyone froze.

"Did... did we just accidentally start the countdown?" Papa whispered, his eyes wide.

Nutty scrambled to the control panel. "No, no! That was just the 'systems check' button! We're good! Everything's fine! Nobody panic!"

"I'm only panicking a LITTLE bit," Mama said, her tail puffed up to twice its normal size.

They re-connected the loose wires, untangled Papa's tail (which took longer than expected), and double-checked all the connections.

As the sun started to set, casting a golden glow over the Big Empty Field (which was now not very empty at all, given the TWO MILLION sticks of TNT covering it), the three Nutwobbles stood back to admire their work.

The TNT was arranged in perfect patterns. The wires were all connected. The colored powder was distributed to create a rainbow effect. The control panel had fourteen backup batteries, three emergency stop buttons, and one very large lever labeled "MAKE IT GO BOOM."

"It's... beautiful," Mama whispered.

"It's spectacular!" Papa agreed.

"It's going to be the BEST celebration ever!" Nutty declared, hugging his clipboard.

Uncle Boom-Boom drove up in his truck to inspect their work. He walked slowly around the entire field, checking connections, testing wires, and nodding approvingly at their safety measures.

"I've got to say," Uncle Boom-Boom said finally, "this is the most professional TNT setup I've ever seen from a bunch of squirrels. You followed every safety rule, you've got proper spacing, excellent wire management, and I counted at least six emergency stop systems. I'm impressed!"

"Really?" Nutty's eyes lit up.

"Really! Now, the celebration is tomorrow night at eight o'clock, right?"

"Right!" all three Nutwobbles answered.

"So you'll activate the system at exactly 8:00 PM, the first explosions will go off, and the whole show should last about five minutes of continuous, spectacular celebration!"

"Five minutes of BOOM!" Papa said excitedly.

"Five minutes of carefully controlled, safely executed, absolutely spectacular BOOM," Mama corrected.

Uncle Boom-Boom showed them how to set the timer on the control panel. "You'll press this button at exactly 7:59 PM to start the one-minute countdown. At 8:00 PM, the show begins! And remember—"

"If anything goes wrong, hit the STOP button!" all three Nutwobbles recited together.

"Exactly! Now get some rest. Tomorrow is going to be a big day!"

As they drove home in the truck (Papa still slightly purple from the powder incident), the three family members were buzzing with excitement.

"I can't wait to see Mayor Oakwood's face when our show starts!" Nutty said.

"I can't wait to see EVERYONE'S face!" Mama added.

"I can't wait to take a shower and stop being purple," Papa said, looking at his reflection in the side mirror.

They spent the evening preparing for the next day, making sure they had:
- Binoculars to watch from a safe distance
- Earplugs (because two million sticks of TNT were going to be LOUD)
- A camera to record the spectacular show
- Extra snacks (because you can't watch fireworks without snacks)
- And one fire extinguisher (just in case of just in case)

As Nutty lay in bed that night, looking up at the ceiling, he couldn't help but smile. Tomorrow, Nutville would have the most amazing 100th anniversary celebration ever.

Nothing could possibly go wrong now!

(Narrator's note: This is called "foreshadowing," and if you're familiar with the Silly Squirrels series, you know that when someone says "nothing could possibly go wrong," something is DEFINITELY about to go wrong.)
