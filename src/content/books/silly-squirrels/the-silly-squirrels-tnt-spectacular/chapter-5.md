# The Best Worst Show Ever

The silence after two million sticks of TNT explode all at once is a very special kind of silence.

It's the kind of silence where everyone's ears are ringing, every animal is trying to figure out what just happened, and every squirrel is wondering if they're about to be in very big trouble.

Nutty, Mama, and Papa slowly emerged from behind the control panel (where they'd been hiding during the last minute of explosions) and looked toward the town.

"Is everyone okay?" Nutty asked in a very small voice.

Uncle Boom-Boom was checking the field with his binoculars. "The town looks... intact! No fires! No damage! Everyone appears to be standing up and... wait..."

"WAIT WHAT?!" all three Nutwobbles shrieked.

"They're... they're applauding?"

Sure enough, from half a mile away, they could hear it starting. One person clapping. Then two. Then ten. Then the entire town of Nutville erupted in the loudest, most enthusiastic applause that had ever been applauded.

"THAT WAS AMAZING!" someone shouted. It was definitely Mr. Rabbit this time.

"BEST FIREWORKS EVER!" Mrs. Hedgehog called out.

"I THINK I SAW MY WHOLE LIFE FLASH BEFORE MY EYES BUT IN A FUN WAY!" Tony the Fox added.

The Nutwobbles looked at each other in confusion.

"They... they liked it?" Mama asked.

"But it was complete chaos!" Papa said. "Everything went wrong! The timer malfunctioned! The stop buttons didn't work! Everyone got lifted off the ground!"

"And look!" Nutty pointed to the town square, where his sharp squirrel eyes could make out something being held up. "Is that... is that Mayor Oakwood's toupee?"

The three family members (plus Uncle Boom-Boom and the volunteer fire department) made their way back to the town square, where they were immediately surrounded by excited citizens.

"That was INCREDIBLE!" Mayor Oakwood gushed, trying to pat his toupee back into place (it was now sitting sideways on his head, but nobody had the heart to tell him). "I've been to fireworks shows in the big city, and NOTHING—absolutely NOTHING—was as spectacular as that!"

"But... but everything went wrong!" Nutty protested.

"Wrong? WRONG?!" Mrs. Hedgehog laughed. "That was the most exciting thing that's happened in Nutville in a HUNDRED YEARS! Literally! Because that's how old the town is! I felt ALIVE!"

"My entire family is still talking about it!" Tony the Fox said, gesturing to his relatives who were all chattering excitedly and comparing notes about which explosion was their favorite.

Mr. Rabbit hopped over, his glasses slightly crooked. "I counted at least forty-seven different colors! FORTY-SEVEN! I didn't even know that many colors existed!"

"And the part where everyone lifted off the ground for a second?" A young rabbit named Rosie piped up. "That was like a gentle celebration bounce! It was magical!"

Papa was looking confused. "So you're not mad that we almost accidentally created a minor disaster?"

"Disaster? This was a TRIUMPH!" Mayor Oakwood declared, throwing his arms wide (which made his toupee shift even more). "We wanted a celebration that Nutville would remember for the next hundred years, and by golly, you delivered! Scientists from three towns over are calling to ask what that colorful cloud in the sky was!"

"Really?" Nutty asked, his ears perking up.

"Really! In fact, the Nutville Gazette wants to interview you for the front page! They're calling it 'The Most Spectacular Celebration in Regional History!'"

A reporter squirrel with a tiny notepad and an even tinier pencil rushed over. "Is it true you used TWO MILLION sticks of TNT?!"

"Two million, three hundred and forty-two," Nutty said automatically. "We were very precise about it."

"INCREDIBLE!" the reporter scribbled frantically. "And the timing malfunction that made everything go faster—was that intentional? Because it created this amazing sense of excitement and chaos that really captured the spirit of celebration!"

"Um," Nutty looked at Mama and Papa. "Sure? Let's go with that. Totally intentional."

Uncle Boom-Boom pulled the three Nutwobbles aside. "Now, I want to be clear," he said in his serious construction-expert voice, "what happened tonight was NOT according to plan. Something went wrong with the timer, the safety systems failed, and by all accounts, that should have been a disaster."

The three Nutwobbles' tails drooped.

"BUT," Uncle Boom-Boom continued with a grin, "you followed every other safety protocol perfectly. The TNT was far enough from town, everyone was at a safe distance, and despite the chaos, nobody got hurt—they just got a slightly more exciting show than expected! You're lucky squirrels. Very, VERY lucky squirrels."

"So we're not in trouble?" Papa asked hopefully.

"Oh, you're in SOME trouble," Uncle Boom-Boom chuckled. "Mostly the trouble of having to explain to everyone why you can't do this again next year."

"Next year?!" Mama's eyes went wide.

"Everyone's already asking!" Mayor Oakwood had appeared next to them, still beaming. "They want to know if this can become an annual tradition!"

"ABSOLUTELY NOT!" all three Nutwobbles said at once.

"Once was spectacular enough!" Nutty added firmly.

"Agreed," Uncle Boom-Boom nodded. "Two million sticks of TNT is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of show. Next year, I suggest going back to regular fireworks. The boring, safe kind that don't make everyone bounce."

As the celebration continued into the night (with much safer activities like cake-eating and dancing), the Nutwobble family found a quiet spot on the edge of the town square to sit and watch everyone having fun.

"You know," Mama said thoughtfully, "when Nutty suggested using two million sticks of TNT, I thought it was our most ridiculous plan ever."

"It WAS our most ridiculous plan ever," Papa pointed out.

"Exactly!" Mama continued. "But somehow, it worked out. Not the way we planned, but it still made everyone happy."

Nutty was looking at the colored powder still drifting in the sky, making the stars look like they were surrounded by gentle, glowing clouds. "Do you think we're too ridiculous sometimes?"

"Absolutely," Papa said immediately.

"Definitely," Mama agreed.

"Without a doubt," Uncle Boom-Boom added, having somehow appeared next to them with a plate of cake.

"But," Papa continued, putting his arm around Nutty's shoulders, "ridiculous is what makes us the Silly Squirrels. And ridiculous is what makes Nutville special."

"Plus," Mama added, "if we weren't ridiculous, who would build submarines out of pickle barrels, or jetpack pizza delivery services, or—"

"Or create the most spectacular fireworks show in the history of everything?" Nutty finished, smiling.

"Exactly!" both parents said together.

Mayor Oakwood's voice came over the microphone again. "Before we end tonight's celebration, I'd like to thank the Nutwobble family—Mama, Papa, and Nutty—for giving Nutville a 100th anniversary celebration we'll never forget! Please join me in a round of applause for the Silly Squirrels!"

The entire town cheered and clapped. Someone started chanting "SILLY SQUIRRELS! SILLY SQUIRRELS!" and soon everyone had joined in.

Nutty felt his face get warm with embarrassment, but also with pride. Sure, things had gone wrong. Sure, the show had been way more chaotic than planned. Sure, they'd accidentally lifted the entire town two inches off the ground for a second.

But they'd also created something spectacular. Something memorable. Something that made everyone happy.

"Hey Nutty?" Papa asked as they walked home later that night, their ears still ringing slightly from the explosions.

"Yeah, Papa?"

"What's your next big idea going to be?"

Nutty thought for a moment, then grinned. "I'm thinking... maybe something quiet for a while. Like... really advanced pillow fort engineering?"

"THAT'S BRILLIANT!" Mama exclaimed.

"As long as the pillows don't explode," Papa added.

"Why would pillows explode?" Nutty asked.

"With you, Nutty? Anything is possible," Papa chuckled.

As they reached their tree house and looked back at the town square, still glowing with lights and echoing with laughter, the three family members smiled.

Nutville's 100th anniversary had been celebrated with:
- Two million, three hundred and forty-two sticks of TNT
- Approximately forty-seven different colors
- One malfunctioning timer
- Three failed emergency stop systems
- One confused cow's very long "moo"
- Zero injuries
- One hundred percent spectacular memories

And really, what more could you ask for in a celebration?

Well, maybe working stop buttons for next time.

And definitely no more TNT.

At least not until Nutville's 200th anniversary.

(Just kidding.)

(Probably.)

**Fun Facts About This Story:**

- Two million sticks of TNT would actually weigh about 2,000 tons! Those must have been some very strong squirrels.
- The "mystery color" that turned out to be sparkly teal was actually created when the purple and green powder mixed in the air.
- The confused cow's name is Bessie, and she now tells all her cow friends about the time she saw the most spectacular show ever.
- Mayor Oakwood's toupee was never quite the same after that night, but he wore it with pride.
- Uncle Boom-Boom later discovered that the timer malfunction was caused by a butterfly that had landed on a circuit board and created an unexpected connection. He named the butterfly "Lucky."

**Safety Reminder:** TNT and explosives are ONLY for trained professionals! The Silly Squirrels had Uncle Boom-Boom's help and followed safety rules (well, mostly). In real life, fireworks should only be handled by licensed experts, and you should always watch them from a safe distance. The safest explosions are the ones in stories!
