# Chapter 4: Working Together

The next morning, Baby Nutty, Mama Nutty, and Papa Nutty met at the top of their tree with a new plan.

"Okay," said Baby Nutty, "I've been thinking. Mama, you're the fastest, so you could scout ahead and find the best acorn spots."

"And Papa," added Mama Nutty, "you're the funniest, which means you're great at making friends. Maybe you could ask the forest animals for help and directions."

"What about you, Baby Nutty?" asked Papa Nutty.

"Well, I'm good at organizing things," said Baby Nutty proudly. "I can keep track of where we've been and where we need to go next."

And so, the three family members set off on their biggest adventure yet. They traveled beyond Nutville, into the forest where tall trees created a canopy of green above them.

Mama Nutty raced ahead and found a grove of oak trees heavy with acorns. Papa Nutty made friends with a helpful rabbit who showed them the safest paths. Baby Nutty kept track of their route and made sure they didn't get lost.

Working together, they gathered more acorns in one day than they had ever collected individually. But the best part wasn't the acorns - it was how much fun they had doing it together.

"You know what?" said Papa Nutty as they headed home, their cheeks stuffed with acorns. "This is way more fun than doing everything alone."

"And we got so much more done!" agreed Mama Nutty.

"Plus, we discovered that we each have special talents that help the family," added Baby Nutty.

From that day on, the three silly squirrels became the best teamwork family in all of Nutville. They helped other animals solve problems, organized town clean-up days, and even started a weekly story-telling circle where Papa Nutty's jokes were always the highlight.

And every winter, they had more than enough acorns - not just for themselves, but to share with any animal in need.
