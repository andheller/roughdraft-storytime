# Chapter 2: The Great Acorn Hunt

As the three family members sat chatting, they noticed something unusual. Their oak tree, which was usually covered in acorns, looked almost empty!

"Where did all the acorns go?" wondered Nutty, scratching his tiny head.

"Maybe the wind blew them away," suggested Mama Nutwobble.

"Or maybe they grew legs and walked away!" joked Papa Nutwobble, making the others giggle.

But this was serious business. Winter was coming, and squirrels need lots of acorns to stay warm and fed.

"I have an idea!" announced Nutty. "Let's go on the Great Acorn Hunt!"

The three family members scampered down the tree and began searching everywhere. They looked under bushes, behind rocks, and even asked the friendly park ducks if they had seen any acorns.

Mama Nutwobble raced to the far end of Nutville, checking every tree. Nutty searched near the playground where children often dropped snacks. Papa Nutwobble looked in the most unusual places, like inside old shoes and empty soda cans.

After hours of searching, they met back at their tree, tired and disappointed.

"I only found three acorns," sighed Mama Nutwobble.

"I found two and a very confused beetle," said Nutty.

"I found one acorn and a really funny-looking leaf that looks like Uncle Whiskers!" laughed Papa Nutwobble, trying to cheer everyone up.

But six acorns wouldn't be enough for winter. What were they going to do?
