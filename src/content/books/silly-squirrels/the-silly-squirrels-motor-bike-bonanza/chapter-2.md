# Nuts, Bolts, and Vroom

At exactly dawn-minus-three-bounces, Mama burst into the workshop. “Good morning! Good morning! GOOD MORNING!” She wore elbow pads, knee pads, and a mixing-bowl helmet with stickers that said “ZOOM” and “PLEASE DON’T PANIC.”

Papa waddled in with a tray. “Pre-wrench snacks.” He’d arranged apple slices to look like tiny tires.

Nutty unrolled a huge blueprint that was mostly doodles with arrows. “We begin with frames. Frame first, wheels second, engine third, horn always.”

They split up.

Mama’s Lightning took shape like it had been waiting its whole life to exist. Mama chose the lightest frame, added leaf-thin fenders, and taped on a lightning-bolt sticker so big it made the bike feel faster just sitting still.

“Aerodynamics!” she declared, holding up two giant maple leaves. She attached them like a spoiler. “Science says this makes you go ‘whoosh’ with extra ‘sh.’”

Papa’s Cloud went the other direction. He lovingly wrapped the seat in two layers of moss (“Comfort layer” and “Second emergency comfort layer.”), bolted on a snack basket, and installed a bell that went “plink” in a gentle, reassuring tone.

“This is a responsible vroom,” he said, patting it. “A considerate vroom.”

Nutty’s Acorn Blaster was an explosion of ideas. He used the smallest frame, which he reinforced with a triangle of spokes “for maximum non-snapping.” He mounted acorn caps as dashboard buttons: one for lights, one for a squeaker horn, and one labeled “DO NOT.”

“What does ‘DO NOT’ do?” Papa asked.

“Ideally nothing,” Nutty said. “But it looks official.”

Next: engines. The trio gathered around a table of parts: a tiny crank motor, a belt drive, some sprockets, and a few “Probably Fine Springs.”

“Mama’s Lightning gets the light crank motor,” Nutty decided. “Papa’s Cloud gets the sturdy one. Mine gets the… experimental one.”

“Define experimental,” Papa said.

“It’s very curly,” Nutty answered, pointing at a springy-sproingy assembly that vibrated just by being looked at.

They measured, bolted, tightened, and occasionally chased runaway screws that rolled away like speedy beetles.

“Helmets?” Mama reminded.

They each put on a mixing-bowl helmet: Mama’s with lightning stickers, Papa’s with a picture of a sandwich, and Nutty’s with a hand-drawn acorn and the words “Supa Dupa Fast (But Careful).” They added elbow pads made from oven mitts and goggles that were actually jar lids with elastic.

“Safety: installed,” Papa pronounced.

“Horn time,” Mama grinned.

TOOT-VROOM!

Papa blinked. “That… that’s beautiful.”

Finally, they lined up the three creations.

Mama’s Lightning looked like it might sprint off by itself. Papa’s Cloud looked like a rolling picnic. Nutty’s Acorn Blaster looked like the inside of Nutty’s brain—curious, hopeful, a little bit sproingy.

“Phase two,” Nutty said, trying to sound like a calm engineer and not a squirrel who wanted to zoom so badly his tail had invented its own vibration. “Test rides.”

Mama stretched like a track star. “I would like to go first please and thank you.”

“Gently,” Papa begged, handing her a snack bar that was really just peanuts glued to more peanuts. “We start slow.”

Mama straddled the Lightning, pressed the acorn start button… and the engine purred like a happy kitten made of bumblebees. She rolled forward, then a little faster… then a lot faster.

“WHOOOOOOSH!” She zipped in a loop around the mill yard, leaves lifting in her wake. “It works! It works! IT WORK—” She squeezed the brakes and skidded to a tidy stop, cheeks flushed, grin enormous. “Brakes work too.”

Papa’s Cloud started with a sturdy “vrummm.” He puttered forward with royal dignity, ringing his gentle bell at a bee. “Hello, bee. Please do not be alarmed by my considerate vroom.”

Nutty climbed onto the Acorn Blaster, goggles askew. “Okay, little buddy. Let’s make good choices.” He pressed start.

SPROING—VROOOOOM—TOOT?

The Blaster shot forward, did a tiny hop, then settled into a nice, eager buzz. Nutty’s tail streamed behind him like a flag.

“We did it!” he shouted, looping around the others. “We built motor-bikes!”

Mama wiped a happy tear. “Tomorrow, test track.”

Papa raised a paw. “And tonight, we rest. Responsible vroomers don’t vroom tired.”

They covered the bikes with a blanket that somehow made them look even faster, like sleeping racehorses dreaming of whoosh.
