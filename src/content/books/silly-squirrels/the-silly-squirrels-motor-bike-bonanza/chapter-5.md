# The Nutville Grand Zoom

Nutville had never seen anything like it. The whole town lined the streets. Banners flapped. Balloons bobbed. The ducklings wore tiny paper numbers like they were in the race, which they were not, but they felt included and that was important.

“Welcome to the first-ever Nutville Grand Zoom and Safety Parade!” Nutty announced from atop a hay bale podium. “Featuring: Mama’s Lightning, Papa’s Cloud, and the Acorn Blaster. We will go fast, but we will also go smart.”

Mrs. Hedgehog waved a checkered dish towel. “Go get ‘em, sweeties!”

“Parade order,” Papa declared. “Safety first!” He led on the Cloud, ringing the hello-goodbye-duet. Mama followed, the Lightning purring. Nutty brought up the rear on the Blaster, tail flagged high.

They rolled past the bakery first. Tony loaded the practice cake—no, a real cake this time—onto Mama’s rack. “Deliver to the gazebo!”

Mama saluted and took off with a whoosh that smelled faintly of vanilla frosting. She returned seconds later, empty rack, thumbs up, crowd cheering.

Next stop: the post office. Mr. Rabbit handed Papa a bundle of ribbons for the Spring Fling banner rescue. “Clock tower’s got our banner in a tangle.”

Papa nodded. “Consider it gently un-tangled.” He vroomed to the square and, with the kind of timing only a dad with two bells possesses, rang once to alert the pigeons and once to applaud himself. The banner came down, pristine and proud.

Nutty’s job: balloons. He carefully towed a string of rainbow balloons from the party store, eyes steady, posture perfect. The stabilizer brace hummed its faithful little hum. He didn’t meep once.

Then the unexpected: a gust of wind rushed down Maple Street, flipping a corner of the banner and sending Mrs. Hedgehog’s hat cart rolling.

“HAT ALERT!” Mama yelled.

Nutty’s paws moved before his brain finished the thought. He leaned into the wind, eased the throttle, and guided the Blaster in a smooth arc. Mama matched him on the Lightning. Papa took the outside line on the Cloud like a velvet boulder.

Together they formed a three-squirrel wedge that corralled the hat cart without a single hat escape. The cart clicked to a stop. The banner settled. The wind gave up.

The crowd went wild. The crow dropped so many leaves it looked like autumn.

Mrs. Hedgehog dabbed her eyes. “My hat angels.”

Tony cupped his paws. “Speech! Speech!”

Nutty took off his mixing-bowl helmet and stood on the Blaster’s pedal. “We thought speed was about going super fast—”

“Supa dupa fast,” Mama corrected, winking.

“—but it’s also about control, and care, and helping your neighbors,” Nutty continued. “Going fast is fun. Going fast together is better. Going fast together safely is best.”

Papa’s bells chimed a little harmony. “Also snacks,” he added softly.

They took one last lap, not as a race, but as a celebration. The Lightning sparkled. The Cloud glowed. The Acorn Blaster hummed like a tiny engine with a big heart.

At the gazebo, the mayor (who was a turtle and therefore deeply impressed by any speed at all) presented medals shaped like little silver acorns. “For service to Nutville,” the mayor said. “And for the coolest parade I’ve ever seen.”

Mama looked at the Lightning, then at Nutty and Papa. “What’s next?”

Nutty’s eyes twinkled. “Today, we rest. Tomorrow, we maintain our responsible vrooms. The day after tomorrow… who knows?”

Papa smiled and held up a picnic basket. “I know one thing. The day after tomorrow probably has sandwiches.”

They sat on the grass with their medals glinting, their motor-bikes parked in a neat little row like three contented cats. The breeze ruffled their fur. The ducklings tried very hard not to chew on the medals. The crow dropped one last leaf in the exact shape of a heart. Again. Definitely destiny this time.

And Nutville, just for a moment, felt like a place where everything could go supa dupa fast… and still somehow be perfectly, wonderfully, gently in control.

The end. For now. VROOM.
