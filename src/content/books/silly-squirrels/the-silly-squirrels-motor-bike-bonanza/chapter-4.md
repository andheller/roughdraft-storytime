# Supa Dupa Speed Trials

The next morning, Nutville woke to the distant sound of practice vrooms.

“Final tweaks,” Nutty said, flipping his pencil like a baton. “We’re going for supa dupa fast, but we’re also going for supa dupa safe.”

Mama installed new brake pads and a hand rest she called the “Calm Paw.” “If your paws are calm, your brain is zoom,” she reasoned, which made just enough sense that they all nodded.

Papa added a second bell to the Cloud. “For passing. And for saying hello. And for duets.” He rang both. The duet was soothing and slightly jazzy.

Nutty fitted a tiny stabilizer brace to the Acorn Blaster’s back end and replaced the meepy horn with a confident one.

TOOT-VROOM!

“Now that’s a horn that believes in itself,” Mama said.

They chalked a big “START” on the mill path. Tony the Fox, Mrs. Hedgehog, Mr. Rabbit, and half of Nutville gathered to watch. The ducklings, too.

“Welcome to the Supa Dupa Speed Trials!” Nutty announced, standing on a crate. The crowd cheered. The crow dropped a ceremonial leaf.

Trial One: Acceleration. Mama crouched like a sprinter. “Ready… set… ZOOM!” The Lightning leapt forward and reached the first flag before Nutty could say “pistachio.”

“Time: fast,” Nutty recorded. “Unit: wow.”

Trial Two: Hill Climb. Papa’s Cloud chugged up the steep bit with noble determination while ringing a gentle “You can do it” bell solo. The crowd clapped in time. At the top he announced, “I would like to thank my seat and also gravity.”

Trial Three: Carry the Cake. Tony revealed a very realistic practice cake made from cardboard and hope. They strapped it to a rack on the Lightning. Mama took the curve with careful grace and returned with cake and dignity intact.

“Trial Four,” Nutty said, eyes bright, “is Control. The cones, the curves, the sudden duck.” The ducklings quacked on cue.

Nutty went last. The Acorn Blaster zipped the straightaway like a happy comet, hugged the curve like it had been practicing in its sleep, and slalomed the cones so neatly that Mrs. Hedgehog dabbed her eyes with a tissue. On the final stretch, a gust of wind tried to push him sideways. The stabilizer held. Nutty leaned, breathed, and crossed the line.

The crowd erupted. The crow dropped three leaves at once.

“Supa,” Mama said, hugging him.

“Dupa,” Papa added, hugging both of them.

“Fast,” Nutty beamed, hugging everyone else.

Mr. Rabbit hopped up and down. “Can you help with the Spring Fling banner?”

Tony nodded eagerly. “And cake. And balloons. And, uh, could we also do a parade that is technically for safety demonstrations but secretly for showing off?”

Mama grinned. “Tomorrow: Nutville Grand Zoom.”

Papa raised both bells. “And tonight: noodle soup. Speed requires noodles.”

The ducklings quacked approval. The crow dropped a leaf shaped like a heart, which was either a coincidence or destiny.
