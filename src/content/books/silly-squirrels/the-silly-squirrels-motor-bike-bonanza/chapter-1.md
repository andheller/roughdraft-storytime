# The Need for Speed

Nutty was timing Mama Nutwobble’s laps around the oak with a walnut and a marker. Every time the walnut rolled past the line he’d drawn in the dirt, he yelled, “Lap!” which was both extremely scientific and extremely silly.

“WHOOOOSH!” Mama blazed by, a brown-orange blur with a big grin. “Was that my fastest yet?”

Nutty held the walnut up like an official stopwatch. “You beat your own record by… a scribble and a half!”

Papa Nutwobble clapped, then immediately sat down because clapping made him hungry. “Incredible! And now, a celebratory snack.” He produced a pocket acorn with a flourish.

Just then Tony the Delivery Fox staggered up the hill pushing a squeaky scooter that looked like it had retired three times already.

“Emergency!” Tony wheezed. “Nutville needs SPEED!”

“We love speed,” Mama said, bouncing. “We practically live in speed.”

“Mrs. Hedgehog’s birthday cake needs to be picked up from the bakery on Walnut Way, Mr. Rabbit’s weather balloons are floating toward Maple Marsh, and the town’s banner for the Spring Fling is tangled on the clock tower again,” Tony gasped. “My scooter can’t keep up and the hills keep getting hillier!”

Nutty’s ears perked. “A town-wide speed problem?” He flipped to a fresh page in his notebook and wrote: Operation Zoomtown.

Mama’s eyes sparkled. “We could run there so fast our sneakers would make musical notes.”

Papa shook his head, crumbs on his whiskers. “Running is great, but what if you need to carry a giant cake, three balloons, and a banner pole? We need… wheels.”

Nutty’s tail pinged straight up. “Wheels! And an engine! And a horn that goes ‘TOOT-VROOM!’” He held up a crumpled magazine from his backpack. “Behold: motor-bikes.”

Mama leaned over the picture of a shiny red machine. “It’s like a bicycle that learned how to roar.”

“But we are squirrels,” Papa said, thoughtful. “Do squirrels roar?”

“We do now,” Mama grinned. “Let’s build the supa dupa speediest motor-bikes Nutville has ever seen!”

Tony blinked. “Can you do that… today?”

Nutty flipped his pencil, catching it like a pro. “Today we plan. Tomorrow we build. The day after tomorrow we VROOM.”

“VROOM responsibly,” Papa added. “With snacks and helmets.”

They marched to the old mill workshop, the place where half the town’s most questionable inventions were born. Inside: toolboxes, spare wheels, a mysterious box labeled “Probably Fine Springs,” and a banner that read “Safety First! (Most of the time.)”

“We’ll need frames,” Nutty said, drawing wobbly bike shapes, “wheels, brakes, and engines. Lightweight but strong. Fast but not fling-you-into-a-bush fast.”

Mama zipped around collecting parts: two sturdy frames, four wheels “that feel zippy in the paw,” a basket of bolts, and three mixing bowls. “For helmets,” she winked.

Papa rolled in a crate of odds-and-ends. “Behold: acorn caps for buttons, leaf-things for style, and a box of chrome stickers shaped like lightning. Also, I found this pretzel.” He ate the pretzel.

Nutty turned the chalkboard around. On it he’d already drawn three ideas:

- Mama’s Lightning: sleek, light, zoomy. “Built for speed,” he said.
- Papa’s Cloud: comfy, sturdy, snack-storage included. “Built for… Papa.”
- Nutty’s Acorn Blaster: tiny frame, big dreams, maximum “whooooosh.”

“Tomorrow,” announced Mama, puffing her chest, “we turn nuts and bolts into VROOM.”

“And brakes,” Papa said, raising a paw. “Promise me there will also be brakes.”

Nutty saluted with the walnut stopwatch. “Operation Zoomtown begins at dawn. We’re going to be speedy fast. Supa dupa fast.”

Outside, a breeze curled through the mill yard, rattling the “Probably Fine Springs” box. It answered with an excited sproing, like it couldn’t wait to go fast either.
