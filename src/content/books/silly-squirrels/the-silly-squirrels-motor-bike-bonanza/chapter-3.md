# Test Track Tumbles

The old mill path wasn’t exactly a racetrack, but it had all the important ingredients: a straightaway, a gentle curve, three suspicious bumps, and one extremely nosy crow who served as the unofficial flag waver.

“Rules,” Nutty said, pointing at a chalkboard he’d dragged outside. “One at a time. Slow to start. Helmets on. If you see a pinecone, you do not eat it while driving, Papa.”

Papa nodded solemnly. “I brought pre-driving pinecones.” He held up two like a responsible snack hero.

The crow squawked and dropped a leaf. “That means ‘ready, set, GO’ in crow,” Mama translated, already vibrating.

Mama went first. The Lightning took off like a whispered secret that turned into a shout. She leaned into the curve, leaves fluttering like a cape.

“She’s so fast she’s making the wind try to keep up,” Papa breathed.

Mama hit the first suspicious bump and caught a little air. “Wheeeeee—!” Then she landed, slightly wobble, perfectly fine. “Note to self,” she called. “Suspicious bumps are indeed suspicious.”

Next, Papa. He settled onto the Cloud and beeped his gentle bell at the crow, who looked personally flattered.

“Steady as a sandwich,” Papa murmured, rolling forward. The Cloud hummed, the moss seat plush, the snack basket secure. He waved to a chipmunk. He waved to a dandelion. He waved to his own reflection in a puddle. Then he hit a suspicious bump.

“Oop!” The Cloud bounced. Papa bounced. The basket did a tiny dance. A granola bar attempted escape; Papa caught it in midair and tucked it back with fatherly tenderness. “All part of the plan.”

Finally, Nutty. He checked his “DO NOT” button (still did nothing), tightened his goggles, and whispered, “We got this.”

He pressed start.

SPROING-VRRR-VRRR-VROOM!

The Acorn Blaster zipped off the line, enthusiastic, wiggly, joyful. Nutty tried the brakes. They braked. He tried the horn.

TOOT-VROOM-MEEP!

“Unexpected meep,” he noted.

And then came bump number three. The Blaster hopped it like a tiny frog, then landed a little—just a little—sideways.

“Wobble wobble—whoa!” Nutty’s tail windmilled. The Blaster fishtailed. Nutty kept it upright by doing the well-known squirrel move called “flail elegantly.”

He skidded to a stop in front of Mama and Papa, who clapped like polite penguins.

Mama leaned in. “How’d it feel?”

Nutty’s goggles were crooked and his grin was wider than his face. “Like my heart grew wheels.”

Papa inspected the Blaster. “Tiny bit tail-wiggly. We add a brace. Also, your horn sounds like it has a cold.”

They tinkered and tried again. Tinkered and tried again. On attempt six, Mama zigged when she should’ve zagged and gently toppled into a pile of leaves that was, fortunately, mostly leaves and only a little bit of rake.

“I am okay!” she announced from inside the leaf pile, giving a thumbs-up. “The leaves are very supportive.”

On attempt eight, Papa’s bell rang so soothingly that a family of ducklings followed him for an entire lap. “Children,” he said, “please do not vroom. You are babies.” The ducklings complied.

On attempt nine, Nutty finally took the curve with zero wobble. He did not meep. He did not sproing. He just… went.

“We’re learning!” Nutty squeaked. “We’re actually getting supa dupa fast!”

The crow dropped another leaf. Mama saluted. “Tomorrow: speed trials. Today: sandwiches.”

Papa produced three. They were shaped like tiny motor-bikes. “For morale,” he said.

“Morale is delicious,” Nutty agreed, mouth full of bravery.
