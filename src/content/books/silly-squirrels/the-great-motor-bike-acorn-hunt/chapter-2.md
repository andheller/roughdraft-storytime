# Chapter 2: Machines Before Morning

The mill woke early. So did the checklist.

Frames first: compact, straight, no wobble. Axles next. Bearings that rolled without complaint. Brakes that did their single job every single time.

Nutty worked the chalkboard like a conductor. “Two turns on each caliper. Test. Then two more if needed.”

Mama tightened cables and tested levers with neat, economical squeezes. “Clean pull. No chatter.”

Papa set out the bowls—three metal domes that, after a bit of careful padding and a lot of measuring, qualified as helmets. He gave them the gentle bonk test. “Approved.”

They named the bikes only after the parts agreed with one another:

- Lightning: a slim frame with a low handlebar and a sensible appetite for corners.
- Cloud: a steady cruiser with a wide seat, a front basket, and storage that would make any picnic nod.
- Acorn Blaster: shorter wheelbase, light and responsive, horn tuned to a polite chirp.

Brackets went on for the cake box. Hooks for the balloon strings. A padded cradle for an acorn that should never rattle.

Tony leaned in the door. “This looks… official.”

“It is,” Mama said, setting a torque wrench down like a period at the end of a sentence.

Test rides traced patient loops around the mill. Lightning carved. Cloud settled. Blaster darted, then settled once Nutty adjusted the headset and stopped treating every straightaway like a dare.

“Horns,” Papa said. Three quick notes chirped across the yard—brief and precise. No fanfare, just signal.

They tuned until the tools stopped arguing back. Pads seated. Cables stretched. Chains whispered instead of clacked. Even the box of “Probably Fine Springs” seemed satisfied, which was a small miracle.

“Fuel,” Papa said, producing a paper bag that smelled like the good part of a bakery. Tony raised a paw. “Borrowed only for observing. Delivery comes after testing,” he promised, already chewing.

By evening the bikes looked like solutions. They lined up by the door: three machines that understood their assignments.

Nutty chalked the route on the inside of his helmet: Walnut Way for the cake, Maple Marsh for the balloons, the clock tower for the banner, then wherever the clues pointed next.

“Start at first light?” Tony asked.

“Sooner,” Mama said. “When the bread racks steam.”

“When the marsh wind is still,” Papa added.

Nutty set the walnut on the bench like a tiny clock on a dock. “When the chalkboard calls time.”

They turned off the mill lights. In the quiet, the bikes clicked softly as warm metal cooled. It sounded like preparation finishing its last sentence.
