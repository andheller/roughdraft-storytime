# Chapter 1: Operation Acorn VROOM

Nutty timed Mama Nutwobble’s laps around the oak with a walnut and a scuffed line in the dirt. Each roll past the mark earned a crisp, “Lap.” Not precise, but it did the job.

Mama cut past in a brown‑orange blur. “Faster that time?”

Nutty held the walnut like a stopwatch. “You edged your record by a scribble and a half.”

Papa clapped, then sat—clapping always made him hungry. “Impressive. Snack?” He produced a pocket acorn with a practiced flourish.

Tony the delivery fox crested the hill, guiding a scooter that squeaked like it was filing a complaint. He caught his breath. “Emergency,” he said. “Nutville needs speed—and also a favor big enough to trip over.”

“We’re comfortable moving quickly,” Mama said, already bouncing.

Tony ticked items off with a paw. “Mrs. Hedgehog’s cake is ready on Walnut Way. Mr. Rabbit’s weather balloons have drifted toward Maple Marsh. The Spring Fling banner has knotted itself to the clock tower again. And the Golden Acorn? Missing from its case.”

Nutty’s ears rose. “The stage piece?”

“Polishing appointment this morning. Empty glass instead.” Tony’s tail flicked. “My scooter can’t keep up with all of this.”

Mama’s eyes sharpened. “Townwide logistics and a missing showpiece. One problem disguised as four.”

Papa brushed crumbs from his whiskers. “Running is fine, but if we have to carry a cake, a bundle of balloons, a pole, and a trophy, we’ll need wheels.”

Nutty’s tail pinged upright. “Wheels. An engine. A horn that says we’re coming—something like ‘toot‑vroom.’” He unfolded a wrinkled magazine. “Motor‑bikes.”

Mama studied the photo. “Like a bicycle that taught itself to purr and then forgot to stop.”

“We’re squirrels,” Papa said. “Do we purr?”

“If necessary,” Mama said. “Let’s build small, fast motor‑bikes and use them to find the Golden Acorn.”

Tony blinked. “Today?”

“Plan today,” Nutty said. “Build tomorrow. Then we ride—and follow the clues.”

“Responsibly,” Papa added. “Helmets. Snacks.”

They crossed the mill yard to the old workshop where the town kept its optimism in boxes. Inside: tool chests, spare wheels, a crate labeled “Probably Fine Springs,” and a banner that read, “Safety First (most of the time).”

Nutty chalked out a list. “Frames, brakes, engines. Light but sturdy. Quick without catapulting anyone into the underbrush. Baskets for cakes, hooks for balloons, a cradle for one delicate acorn.”

Mama moved through the shelves with a practiced sweep: two compact frames, four true‑running wheels, a pail of bolts, three mixing bowls. “Helmets,” she said, tapping the bowls.

Papa rolled in a crate of odds and ends. “Acorn caps for buttons. Leaf trim if we’re feeling dramatic. Lightning stickers if we’re not.” He found a pretzel. He considered it. He ate it.

Nutty flipped the chalkboard. Three sketches waited there:

- Mama’s Lightning: sleek, light, built to carve corners.
- Papa’s Cloud: comfortable, sturdy, unapologetically outfitted with snack storage.
- The Acorn Blaster: compact frame, big ambition.

“Tomorrow,” Mama said, “we turn parts into motion.”

“And brakes,” Papa said. “Non‑negotiable.”

Nutty saluted with the walnut. “Operation Acorn VROOM starts at dawn. Cake retrieval, balloon recovery, banner rescue—and we track the acorn.”

Tony tilted his head. “Track it how?”

Nutty tapped his detective doodle: a squirrel in a helmet with serious eyebrows. “Crumbs, string marks, knot patterns. Everything leaves a draft. We’ll read it.”

Outside, a breeze lifted sawdust and set the “Probably Fine Springs” to a polite sproing, like they were clearing their throats.

“Rest,” Mama said.

“Pack,” Papa said.

“Map,” Nutty said, and drew a star beside: Operation Acorn VROOM.

Tomorrow, Nutville would hear new sounds: brief horns, low engines, the steady hum of a plan leaving the chalkboard.

Across town, blue balloons tugged at their strings over Maple Marsh. On the clock tower, a banner worried itself into knots. And somewhere between bakery and stage, the Golden Acorn sat very much out of place.
