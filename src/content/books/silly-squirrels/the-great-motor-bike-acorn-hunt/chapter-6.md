# Chapter 6: Spring Fling, Right on Time

The annex smelled like sawdust, fresh paint, and lemon oil that had decided to live here. The round shape on the bench wasn’t just round; it was the Golden Acorn, cradled in a padded ring, halfway through a careful polish. A fan hummed. A note sat under a paperweight shaped like a star.

Brigsley Badger looked up from a brace bracket. “You made good time,” he said, not surprised, not guilty—busy. “The pedestal base was wobbling again. I borrowed the acorn at four, left a note with the mayor’s office.” He lifted the paperweight and turned the card over. The ink showed through faintly on the wrong side. “Ah. Paper’s heavier than it looks.”

Nutty read the card: Borrowed for brace repair. Return by noon. —B.B. Lemon oil in progress. He held it up. “Your note went invisible.”

“It does that when I forget which way is up,” Brigsley said. “Apologies for the alarm.” He nodded at the bikes. “Clever. Cake rack. Balloon hook. Acorn cradle. You planned for the town we actually have.”

“That was the idea,” Mama said. “Can we help finish?”

They did, with the rhythm you learn when hands agree. Brigsley tightened the brace. Papa steadied the base while pretending not to eye the cake box. Mama re‑stitched a frayed banner edge Brigsley had set aside for later. Nutty polished the last crescent of acorn until it caught the light and kept it.

At eleven‑forty‑five they rolled into the square with the cake intact, the balloons steady, the banner behaving, and the Golden Acorn riding like a quiet sun.

The mayor exhaled in one piece. “That’s… on time.”

“With a brace,” Brigsley added, tapping the pedestal. The acorn didn’t wobble. Everyone pretended not to notice, then did notice, then clapped because improvement deserves noise.

“Thank you, Tony,” the mayor said. “And the Nutwobbles.”

Tony raised both paws. “They did the moving. I did the worrying.”

“Valuable work,” Papa said.

The Spring Fling began on schedule. Music threaded through the square. Children counted the balloons and lost track and started again. The cake lifted its frosting proudly and did not slide.

“We should keep the bikes ready,” Mama said, watching the square rearrange itself into celebration.

“Courier duty?” Tony asked.

“Event duty,” Nutty said. “And everyday duty.” He tapped his helmet, where the chalk route had smudged into a small map of the morning. “There’s always a list.”

They parked together and listened. The town made its own engine—a steady, warm sound of doors, feet, greetings, and someone’s clarinet trying its best. Over it, three small horns answered only when needed.

On the stage, the Golden Acorn held still on its new brace and collected sunlight like a promise properly framed.
