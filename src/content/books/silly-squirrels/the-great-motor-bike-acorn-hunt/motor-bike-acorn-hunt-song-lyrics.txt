THE GREAT MOTOR-BIKE ACORN HUNT SONG
"Toot‑Vroom, Find the Acorn!"

[VERSE 1]
Tony huffed up Nut Hill, scooter going “eeeee”
“Jobs on jobs, and the Golden Acorn’s… free!”
Nutty clicked his walnut like a tiny clock
“Mystery plus errands? Okay, let’s rock.”
Mama grinned, “We’ll move like lightning, neat!”
Papa packed snacks like a marching treat.

[CHORUS]
Toot‑vroom, toot‑vroom, helmets on our heads!
Whirr‑purr engines, crumbs and clue‑threads!
Left paw, right paw, follow what we find—
Toot‑vroom, toot‑vroom, acorn on our mind!

[VERSE 2]
Down at the mill with the Maybe‑Fine Springs
Three little bikes, three splendid things:
Mama’s Lightning—fast and bright,
Papa’s Cloud—comfy, snack‑tight,
Nutty’s Blaster—small but bold,
Chrome acorn buttons (and one made of gold?).

[CHORUS]
Toot‑vroom, toot‑vroom, baskets, hooks, and tape!
Whirr‑purr engines, snacks for every scrape!
Left paw, right paw, clues don’t like to wait—
Toot‑vroom, toot‑vroom, we won’t be late!

[VERSE 3]
Walnut Way crumbs say, “Cake this way.”
Maple Marsh balloons tug, “Sway, don’t stray.”
Clock‑tower banner knots whisper, “Look twice.”
Every little clue adds a little slice.
Ears up, whiskers twitch—detective mode on.
If the acorn’s hiding, it won’t for long.

[BRIDGE]
Blink, beep, careful on the turn—
Tiny horns sing what we learn.
Ask the wind, ask the string,
Ask the footprints on the wing.
We read the town like open books—
Even banners have opinions on hooks.

[FINAL CHORUS]
Toot‑vroom, toot‑vroom, follow every thread!
Whirr‑purr engines, clues in squirrel‑head!
Left paw, right paw, roll the mystery wide—
Toot‑vroom, toot‑vroom, Golden Acorn ride!

(TAG)
Toot‑vroom—helmets snug and bright.
Toot‑vroom—we’ll find it, alright.
Toot‑vroom—Nutville’s humming tune…
Acorn found soon—vroom vroom vroom!

SONG NOTES:
- Call‑and‑response: leader sings “Toot‑vroom,” kids answer “Helmets on!”
- Add gentle horn beeps on “Toot‑vroom”; soft engine mouth‑sounds on “whirr‑purr.”
- Clap on beats 2 and 4 in the chorus.
- Keep verses punchy; avoid filler words so it stays catchy.
- Works as a classroom or bedtime sing‑along; no heavy repetition required.
