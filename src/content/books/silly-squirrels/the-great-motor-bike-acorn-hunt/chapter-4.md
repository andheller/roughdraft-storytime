# Chapter 4: Marsh Signals

Maple Marsh lay flat as a held breath. A string of blue balloons tugged above the reeds like punctuation that refused to land.

Mr. Rabbit stood on the boardwalk, hat in his paws. “They were for the weather table,” he said. “Now they’re for the sky.”

Mama nodded to Nutty. He eased Blaster forward and lifted the hook from his handlebar. The first pull brought down a ribbon. The second, two balloons. The third, the cluster—gentle work, steady wrists, no sudden moves. The strings settled around his grip like cooperative noodles.

“Saved,” Mr. Rabbit said, relief loosening his shoulders. “I can weigh them with the jar weights now.” He peered at the knots. “Who tied these? Not me.”

Nutty checked the string. Tidy figure‑eights with a telltale extra wrap. “Rigger’s habit,” he said. “Same as the banner ropes.”

Mr. Rabbit leaned closer. “Badger does that. He says ropes shouldn’t surprise you.”

Blue paint flecks dotted one ribbon. Nutty rolled one between his fingers. A match for the chips from the bakery.

“You saw anything carted past?” Papa asked.

“Before sunup,” Mr. Rabbit said. “Crate on a small handcart, heavy for whoever pushed it. Went toward the mill annex—the stage shop behind town hall. I waved. They waved with their elbow.”

They secured the balloons to Cloud’s rear rack, strings gathered in a clean bundle that did not argue with the wind.

“Clock tower next,” Mama said.

“Banner?” Mr. Rabbit asked.

“Banner,” Mama said. “And a view.”

They rode the boardwalk out with their shadows walking beside them on water. The marsh let them pass without a squeak from a single board. The only sound was a handful of thoughtful horn notes when they reached the road.
