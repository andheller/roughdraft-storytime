# Chapter 3: Crumbs on Walnut Way

Walnut Way smelled like sugar and warm stories. The bakery windows were fogged, and Mrs. Hedgehog moved through the haze with a steady rhythm, dusting a final ring of powdered sugar onto a tall cake.

“Delivery for the Fling,” she said, sliding the box toward Papa’s Cloud. “And a question I didn’t expect to ask before sunrise—are we missing a very important acorn?”

“Temporarily,” Mama said. “We’re working on ‘found.’”

Nutty inspected the cake straps and the basket fit. “We’ll keep it level. What did you notice this morning?”

Mrs. Hedgehog tapped the counter. “Smell it? Lemon oil. A little sharp, a little clean. Someone wheeled a crate past just before dawn, left a thin track of it on the tiles. Triangle tread. Not my rack. Not the mayor’s dolly either.”

Nutty crouched and checked the floor. On the checker tiles, a faint scuff line angled toward the door. He rubbed it and sniffed the pad of his paw. “Polish. Not furniture polish. Stage polish.”

Mrs. Hedgehog nodded. “Blue flecks on the mat, too. Same shade as the stage trim.” She produced them like a magician: three tiny chips in her palm, the exact color of the Fling’s backdrop.

Tony leaned into the doorway. “Stage crew?”

“Possibly,” Mama said. “Or someone borrowing their tools and taste in paint.”

They swaddled the cake in a tidy harness. The box sat on Cloud as if it had been built to be chauffeured.

“One more thing,” Mrs. Hedgehog said, lowering her voice. “Brigsley Badger came in for coffee at four. Said, ‘brace the base,’ then left with a roll of non‑slip tape and my last lemon. Paid, of course.”

Papa adjusted the front strap. “Brace. Base.” He pictured the Acorn’s wobbly pedestal last year when the mayor knocked it and everyone pretended not to see the wobble.

Outside, Nutty examined the doorstep for more marks. The triangle tread reappeared faintly, heading away from Walnut Way toward the marsh road. He bent close. A short thread of blue was caught under a nail head.

“Trail to Maple Marsh,” he said.

“Convenient,” Tony said. “That’s where the balloons are learning to leave.”

They nudged into motion: Lightning ahead to scout, Blaster to the side to mind the strings when they found them, Cloud in the center with the cake riding like a passenger with opinions.

They kept their horns brief, their speed steady, and their eyes on the path where the polish scent thinned and the reed smell started.
