# Chapter 5: Knots and the Clock

The clock tower kept its own counsel. The banner did not.

It had found a way to braid itself into the railing and was flapping in a language that mostly said, “Help.”

Mama anchored Lightning against the lowest post. Papa braced Cloud and produced a coil of safety line. Nutty clipped in with deliberate clicks. They worked quiet and unhurried, because height appreciates manners.

The knots were the kind Brigsley Badger liked: functional, tidy, and, when rushed, unforgiving. Nutty loosened them in sequence, marking each one in his head, reading the story of hands that had done this quickly, probably with a tool clenched between their teeth.

“Extra wrap,” Mama said softly. “His signature.”

They freed the banner and re‑ran it clean so the wind could say what it wanted without catching.

From the tower’s view, Nutville arranged itself into sense. Walnut Way was a neat line of roofs. The marsh was a blue thumbprint. Behind town hall, the mill annex sat with its doors open to the morning. On a workbench by the open bay, something round under cloth caught light.

“There,” Nutty said.

Tony shaded his eyes. “Round and important.”

They checked the banner one more time—no slack, even tension—and rode toward the annex with the feeling you get when puzzle pieces stop pretending they’re strangers.
