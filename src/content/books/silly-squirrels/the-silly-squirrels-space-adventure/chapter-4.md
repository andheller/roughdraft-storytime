# The Parachute Crash Landing

Falling through space was, Nutty decided, simultaneously the most terrifying and most exhilarating experience of his entire life.

"ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE GOING THIS FAST?" Papa shouted over the rushing wind as they plummeted toward Earth, their giant patchwork parachute streaming behind them like a rainbow comet tail.

"I DON'T THINK THERE'S A 'SUPPOSED TO' WHEN YOU'RE FALLING FROM SPACE!" Mama yelled back, doing involuntary aerial acrobatics as they tumbled through the atmosphere.

"ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS," Nutty called out, consulting his notebook while falling at terminal velocity (which was both impressive multitasking and absolutely ridiculous), "WE SHOULD DEPLOY THE PARACHUTE IN 3... 2... 1... NOW!"

They pulled the ripcord together.

*WHOMP!*

The enormous parachute unfurled above them - a magnificent patchwork of curtains, bedsheets, and Papa's polka-dot pajamas. For a moment, it looked like everything was going to work perfectly.

For exactly one moment.

Then the wind caught their massive chute and began spinning them like a top.

"WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!" all three squirrels screamed as they whirled around and around, the ground rushing up to meet them at an alarming speed.

"I'M GETTING DIZZY!" Papa wailed, clutching his emergency chocolate.

"THE GROUND IS SPINNING!" Mama observed, though technically they were the ones doing the spinning.

"HOLD ON TIGHT!" Nutty shouted. "WE'RE COMING IN FOR A LANDING!"

Below them, the entire town of Nutville had gathered in the field to watch their return. Mrs. Hedgehog was pointing and shouting something about "controlled descent," while Mr. Rabbit was running around with a blanket, trying to predict where they might land.

The parachute spun them faster and faster as they descended. Trees whizzed by in a blur. The ground grew larger and larger. And then...

*CRASH!*

*THUD!*

*BOUNCE!*

*ROLL!*

*BONK!*

They hit the ground with tremendous force, the parachute billowing around them like a gigantic, colorful tent. They bounced once, twice, three times across the field, rolling and tumbling in a tangle of fabric, squirrels, and scattered snacks.

When everything finally stopped moving, there was complete silence.

"Is everyone okay?" came Nutty's muffled voice from somewhere inside the parachute tent.

"I think I'm upside down," Papa's voice replied. "But the chocolate survived!"

"I can't tell which way is up," Mama added, "but I can see my own tail, so that's probably not good."

The entire town of Nutville came running over to help untangle them from their parachute. When they finally emerged, dizzy and covered in grass stains, the crowd burst into applause.

"You did it!" Mrs. Hedgehog cheered. "My TV is working perfectly now!"

"The weather channel is crystal clear!" Mr. Rabbit added.

"And my GPS is working better than ever!" Tony the Fox called out.

The three space heroes sat in the grass, still a bit wobbly from their spinning descent, looking around at their cheering neighbors.

"We actually fixed the satellites," Nutty said with wonder in his voice.

"We actually went to space," Mama added, still not quite believing it.

"We actually survived crashing back to Earth," Papa finished, taking a well-deserved bite of his emergency chocolate.

But just as they were starting to celebrate their incredible success, Nutty noticed something strange. The world was starting to get darker around the edges. The sounds of the cheering crowd were getting fainter and fainter.

"Guys?" he said uncertainly. "Does everything look like it's getting... fuzzy... to you?"

The last thing he saw was Mama and Papa reaching toward him with concerned expressions, and then everything went completely black.

The crash landing had been more intense than any of them had realized. And Nutty, brave Commander Nutty who had led them all the way to space and back, was about to discover that sometimes the most amazing adventures happen in the most unexpected places.

But that's a story for the next chapter, when everything he thought he knew about their space mission would turn out to be not quite what it seemed.

As consciousness faded away, Nutty could have sworn he heard a voice calling his name from very far away... or maybe very close by.

"Nutty? Nutty, wake up!"

But that couldn't be right. He was already awake, wasn't he?

Wasn't he?
