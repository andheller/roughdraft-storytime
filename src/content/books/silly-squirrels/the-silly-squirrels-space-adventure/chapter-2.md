# The 4-Stage Rocket Plan

The next morning, Nutty woke up before dawn, practically vibrating with excitement. He had spent the entire night dreaming about rockets and space and satellites, and he couldn't wait to get started building their cosmic transportation.

"MAMA! PAPA!" he shouted, bouncing on their bed like a tiny, furry trampoline. "IT'S ROCKET DAY!"

Papa Nutwobble opened one eye. "Nutty, the sun isn't even up yet."

"THE SUN DOESN'T MATTER! WE'RE GOING TO SPACE! SPACE IS FULL OF SUNS!"

"That's... technically true," Mama mumbled from under her pillow.

Within an hour (and after a very quick breakfast of acorn pancakes), the three squirrels had gathered in their "engineering workshop," which was really just the area behind their tree where they kept all their building supplies from previous adventures.

Nutty had his space magazine open to the rocket diagram, his notebook ready, and approximately seventeen different colored pencils spread out for "technical drawing purposes."

"Okay, family!" he announced, adjusting his tiny safety goggles. "According to this magazine, we need to build a 4-stage rocket. Let me explain the science!"

He drew a tall, wobbly rocket in his notebook, with different sections labeled.

"Stage 1 is the bottom - that's our main fuel tank and the biggest booster engines. This is what gets us off the ground and through the atmosphere!"

"What kind of fuel?" Papa asked, genuinely curious.

"Well..." Nutty flipped through the magazine frantically. "It says here that real rockets use something called 'liquid oxygen and kerosene,' but I think we can substitute with..." He looked around their supplies. "...maple syrup and fizzy soda! Sugar gives you energy, right?"

"I mean, it makes you bounce off the walls," Mama observed.

"EXACTLY! Stage 2 and Stage 3 are the middle boosters. When Stage 1 runs out of fuel, we drop it off and Stage 2 takes over. Then when Stage 2 is empty, Stage 3 kicks in! It's like having backup energy for your backup energy!"

Papa was taking notes too, because this was getting impressively complicated even for a Silly Squirrels project.

"And Stage 4," Nutty continued with a flourish, "is our crew capsule! That's where we sit, and where we keep all our important space equipment!"

"Like what?" Mama asked.

"Snacks!" Nutty declared. "LOTS of snacks! And our tools for fixing satellites! And a giant parachute for our landing!"

They spent the morning gathering materials from all over Nutville. For the main fuel tank (Stage 1), they found a huge metal trash can that Mr. Beaver had been throwing away. For the booster stages, they collected various sized barrels, buckets, and containers.

"This is going to be TALL," Papa observed as they stacked everything up in order.

"The taller the better!" Nutty cheered. "We need to get really, really high to reach space!"

For the engines, they rigged up a system of fizzy soda bottles with holes poked in the bottom. "When we shake these up and release them, they'll shoot out pressurized soda and push us upward!" Nutty explained.

"Like those bottle rockets we made last summer?" Mama asked.

"Exactly! But BIGGER!"

The crew capsule (Stage 4) was made from a large wooden crate they'd "borrowed" from behind the general store. Nutty carefully installed windows (clear plastic sheets), control panels (an old keyboard and some colorful buttons), and most importantly, the snack storage compartment.

"Look!" he said proudly, opening a small box inside the capsule. "I packed trail mix, acorn cookies, dried berries, AND emergency chocolate!"

"Emergency chocolate?" Papa's eyes widened with respect.

"For really serious space situations."

The giant parachute was Mama's masterpiece. She had sewn together every colorful piece of fabric she could find - old curtains, bedsheets, even some of Papa's polka-dot pajamas.

"It's enormous!" Nutty gasped as they spread it out to test the size.

"Has to be," Mama said practically. "We'll be falling from really, really high up. This parachute needs to catch a lot of air to slow us down safely."

By late afternoon, their 4-stage rocket stood proudly in the field behind their tree. It was magnificent. It was ridiculous. It was absolutely the most wonderfully over-engineered contraption three squirrels had ever built.

Stage 1 (bottom): Massive trash can filled with maple syrup, surrounded by the biggest soda bottle engines.

Stage 2: Medium barrel with medium-sized bottle rockets.

Stage 3: Smaller bucket with smaller bottles for fine-tuned control.

Stage 4 (top): Their cozy crew capsule with windows, snacks, and the giant parachute packed on top.

"It's beautiful," Papa whispered, wiping away a proud tear.

"It's going to work perfectly," Mama declared, though she was secretly wondering how they were going to light all those bottle rockets at the same time.

"Tomorrow," Nutty announced, climbing up to peer into their crew capsule, "we launch! Tomorrow, we become the first squirrels in space!"

As the sun set behind their towering rocket, three very excited (and slightly worried) squirrels spent the evening double-checking their supplies, practicing their countdown, and dreaming about the incredible adventure waiting for them among the stars.

"T-minus one day until liftoff!" Nutty called out to the sky.

Somewhere up there, broken satellites were waiting to be fixed by the most determined, most ridiculous, most wonderfully silly space crew in the history of Nutville.
