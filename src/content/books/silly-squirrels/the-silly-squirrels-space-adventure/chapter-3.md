# Blast Off to Space!

Launch day dawned bright and clear, with not a single cloud in the sky - perfect weather for three squirrels to attempt their first space mission.

Nutty had been awake since 4 AM, running final checks on their rocket systems and making sure all the soda bottles were properly pressurized. He'd even made official astronaut name tags: "Commander Nutty," "Captain Mama," and "Chief Snack Officer Papa."

"All systems check!" Nutty announced, consulting his clipboard of Very Important Launch Procedures. "Stage 1 fuel tank: filled with premium maple syrup!"

"Check!" Papa called out, giving the big trash can a friendly pat.

"Stage 2 and 3 booster rockets: loaded and ready!"

"Check!" Mama reported, bouncing excitedly around the middle sections.

"Stage 4 crew capsule: snacks secured, parachute packed, windows clean!"

"Triple check!" they all shouted together.

The entire town of Nutville had gathered to watch their launch. Mrs. Hedgehog brought her knitting. Mr. Rabbit set up a picnic blanket. Even Tony the Fox had taken a break from deliveries to witness what he was calling "either the most amazing thing ever, or the most spectacular disaster in Nutville history."

"Possibly both!" Papa had cheerfully agreed.

The three astronaut squirrels climbed into their crew capsule, with Nutty taking the captain's seat (a cushioned bucket) and Mama and Papa strapping themselves in with seatbelts made from jump ropes.

"Mission Control," Nutty spoke into his walkie-talkie (which was actually just a banana painted silver), "this is Squirrel Space Mission 1, requesting permission for launch!"

Mrs. Hedgehog played along, shouting back through her own "radio" (a soup can): "Permission granted, Commander Nutty! The weather is clear, the wind is calm, and we're all ready to watch you fix those satellites!"

"T-minus 10!" Nutty began the countdown, his voice getting more excited with each number.

"9!" Papa unwrapped his emergency chocolate, just in case.

"8!" Mama started doing stretches in her tiny space, because astronauts need to stay limber.

"7!" The crowd below began counting along.

"6!" Nutty's paws hovered over the ignition switches for all their bottle rocket engines.

"5!" 

"4!"

"3!" 

"2!"

"1!"

"BLAST OFF!"

Nutty flipped every switch at once. The soda bottles began shooting fizzy streams in every direction. The maple syrup fuel tank started bubbling and gurgling. The whole rocket began to shake and rattle and...

*WHOOOOOOOOSH!*

They were flying! Actually, truly, completely flying through the air! The ground fell away beneath them as Stage 1 launched them up, up, UP into the sky!

"IT'S WORKING!" Nutty screamed with delight, watching Nutville get smaller and smaller below them.

"I CAN SEE THE WHOLE FOREST!" Mama shouted, pressing her face against the window.

"THE SNACKS ARE HOLDING UP GREAT!" Papa reported, which was obviously the most important safety check.

*POP!* Stage 1 ran out of fuel and detached, just like they'd planned. Now Stage 2 kicked in with its medium-sized bottle rockets, carrying them even higher.

They soared through fluffy white clouds, past surprised birds, past the tops of the tallest trees. The air got thinner and cooler, and they could see for miles and miles in every direction.

*POP!* Stage 2 finished its job and fell away. Stage 3 fired up, pushing them up through the atmosphere with its precision bottle rockets.

"Look!" Nutty pointed through the window with wonder. "The sky is getting darker! And look at all those stars!"

Indeed, they were so high now that the sky had turned from blue to deep purple to almost black, with stars twinkling like diamonds all around them.

*POP!* Stage 3 completed its mission and dropped away, leaving just their crew capsule floating in the vast darkness of space.

"We did it," Papa whispered in amazement. "We actually made it to space."

Below them, the Earth looked like a giant blue and green marble, slowly spinning in the cosmic darkness. Above them, stars sparkled in constellations they'd never seen from the ground.

"It's beautiful," Mama breathed, doing slow-motion somersaults in the zero gravity.

But Nutty was focused on their mission. Through the window, he could see several satellites floating nearby - some working properly with blinking lights, others dark and obviously broken.

"There! That's the main communications satellite that's causing all the trouble!" He pointed to a large, damaged satellite spinning slowly in the darkness. "Let's go fix it!"

Using small puffs from their remaining emergency bottle rockets, they maneuvered their capsule close to the broken satellite. Papa opened their special space toolbox (filled with duct tape, wire, and his famous "fix-anything" hammer), and Mama prepared their space suits (winter coats with goldfish bowls duct-taped over their heads).

For the next hour, the three space squirrels worked together to repair broken antenna connections, replace damaged solar panels, and give the satellite's computer a good old-fashioned restart by unplugging it and plugging it back in.

"Try it now!" Nutty called out as they finished their repairs.

The satellite's lights blinked back to life! Its antenna began rotating properly! The communication signals started flowing again!

"Mission accomplished!" they cheered, high-fiving each other in slow motion.

But just as they were celebrating their success, Nutty noticed something concerning. "Uh, guys? How exactly are we supposed to get back down to Earth?"

They looked at their fuel gauges. Empty. They looked at their rocket engines. Gone with the dropped stages. They looked at each other with sudden realization.

"The parachute!" Mama exclaimed. "We still have our giant parachute!"

"But how do we get moving downward in the first place?" Papa wondered.

Nutty thought for a moment, then grinned with that mischievous look that usually meant either brilliant success or spectacular disaster.

"We jump!" he declared.

And with that, Commander Nutty opened the crew capsule door, grabbed onto their enormous parachute, and leaped out into the vast emptiness of space, with Captain Mama and Chief Snack Officer Papa holding on tight behind him.

Down, down, down they plummeted toward the little blue marble that was home, their parachute billowing out behind them like a colorful comet tail, ready for the most epic landing in the history of Nutville.

"BEST. ADVENTURE. EVER!" Nutty shouted as they fell through the stars toward Earth.
