# The Satellite Situation

It was a perfectly ordinary Tuesday morning in Nutville when Nutty discovered the town's newest problem. He was up in his favorite tree branch, trying to fix his grandmother's old radio, when all he could hear was static and weird beeping sounds.

"BEEP... BEEP... BEEP... BOOP... BZZZZT..."

"What in the name of acorns is going on?" Nutty muttered, giving the radio a gentle whack with his tiny paw.

Down below, he could see Mrs. Hedgehog standing in her garden, pointing her satellite dish in every direction possible. "Come ON!" she shouted at the sky. "I'm missing my favorite cooking show!"

Mr. Rabbit was on his roof, spinning his TV antenna like a pinwheel. "The weather channel is just showing snow! Literal snow! On the screen!"

Even Tony the Delivery Fox was having trouble - his GPS kept saying "SIGNAL LOST" in a very annoying robot voice.

Nutty's ears perked up with curiosity. He scampered down from his tree and started investigating, his notebook tucked under his arm as always.

"What's happening to everyone's satellite signals?" he asked Mrs. Hedgehog.

"Oh, Nutty dear," she sighed, "something's wrong with the satellites up in space. Without them, we can't get our TV shows, weather reports, or even use our phones properly!"

"Satellites?" Nutty's eyes lit up with that familiar spark of excitement. "You mean those things that fly around in space and send signals back to Earth?"

"Exactly! But apparently one of the main ones is broken, and it's messing up all the others."

Nutty scratched his furry chin thoughtfully. This was clearly a job for the Silly Squirrels! But how could they possibly fix something that was way up in space?

He raced back to the old oak tree where Mama and Papa Nutwobble were trying to watch the news on their fuzzy, staticky TV.

"The signal keeps cutting out!" Mama complained, bouncing impatiently from foot to foot.

"I can't even tell if that's a weather reporter or a talking potato!" Papa added, squinting at the screen.

"Mama! Papa!" Nutty burst in, doing his signature dramatic entrance flip. "I've got it! I know how to solve Nutville's satellite problem!"

Papa Nutwobble paused mid-channel-surf. "Let me guess - it involves something wonderfully ridiculous?"

"Even MORE ridiculous than usual!" Nutty grinned, pulling out a space magazine he'd found in someone's recycling. On the cover was a picture of a massive rocket launching into the starry sky. "We're going to build our own rocket ship and fly to space to fix the satellites ourselves!"

Mama and Papa looked at each other, then at Nutty, then at the magazine cover showing the enormous rocket with flames shooting out the bottom.

"Space," Mama said slowly.

"With a rocket," Papa added.

"The final frontier!" Nutty declared with jazz hands.

"But Nutty," Mama pointed out, "space is very, very, VERY far away. Like, further than the next town. Further than the big city. Further than—"

"Further than the pizza place on the OTHER side of the forest?" Papa gasped.

"WAY further than that!"

Nutty was undeterred. He opened the magazine to a page showing a diagram of a multi-stage rocket. "Look at this! It says here that rockets work in stages. You have the fuel tanks and boosters on the bottom to get you off the ground, then you drop them off when you don't need them anymore, and the crew capsule on top takes you all the way to space!"

"Crew capsule?" Papa's tail twitched nervously.

"That's where we sit! And look—" Nutty pointed excitedly at another picture, "—we can bring snacks! It says right here that astronauts need to pack food for their space missions!"

"Well," Papa brightened considerably, "if there are snacks involved..."

"And the best part," Nutty continued, his voice reaching that squeaky-excited pitch, "is that when we're done fixing the satellites, we use a giant parachute to float safely back to Earth! Just like the real astronauts!"

Mama Nutwobble was already mentally designing their rocket, because when you're the fastest squirrel in Nutville, your brain moves pretty fast too. "We'd need something really powerful to launch us that high..."

"And really sturdy to keep us safe in space," Papa added thoughtfully.

"And REALLY good snacks for such a long trip," Nutty finished.

The three family members stared at the magazine, imagining themselves zooming through space in their homemade rocket, fixing satellites and saving Nutville's communication systems.

"So," Papa said slowly, "tomorrow we build a rocket ship?"

"Tomorrow we build a rocket ship!" Mama agreed.

"The best, most amazingly ridiculous rocket ship that three squirrels have ever built!" Nutty cheered.

As the sun set over Nutville, casting long shadows across their fuzzy, still-staticky TV screen, three very excited squirrels began planning the most spectacular adventure of their lives.

Little did they know, this would be an adventure that was quite literally out of this world.
