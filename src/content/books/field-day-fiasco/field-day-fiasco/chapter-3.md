# Chapter 3: The Events Begin

The three-legged race was a disaster.

Not because my parents were slow. Actually, they were incredibly fast. Once they understood the rules—that two people's adjacent legs get tied together to create a "third leg"—they approached it like an engineering problem.

"We need to synchronize our stepping cadence," Dad said, pulling out a small notebook. "If we establish a rhythm of 1.2 steps per second—"

"Agreed. I'll count prime numbers. You match my pace."

"Two! Three! Five! Seven! Eleven!"

They shot down the field like a two-headed rocket, leaving other parents stumbling in the dust.

"WINNERS!" Coach Thompson announced. "Dr. and Mr. Chen take the three-legged race!"

For one beautiful moment, I felt hope.

Then the egg-and-spoon race started.

---

The rules were simple: balance an egg on a spoon, walk to the finish line, don't drop the egg. If you touch the egg with your other hand, you're disqualified.

Mom stared at her egg. Then at the spoon. Then back at the egg.

"I'm not permitted to touch the egg."

"Correct," said the event coordinator.

"At any point."

"That's right."

"So if the egg begins to wobble, I cannot correct its position."

"You just have to balance it and—"

"The optimal strategy, then, is to never move."

"What?"

Mom planted her feet firmly. "If I don't move, the egg cannot fall. Movement introduces variables. Variables introduce instability. Instability leads to egg displacement."

She became a statue.

Dad nodded approvingly. "Sound reasoning."

"Ma'am, you have to WALK to the finish line."

"Do I? The rules stated I cannot touch the egg. You didn't specify a time limit."

The coordinator looked at me helplessly.

"Mom," I said through gritted teeth. "The point is to get to the finish line BEFORE the other people."

"That wasn't stated explicitly."

"IT'S HEAVILY IMPLIED."

She didn't move. Her egg sat perfectly balanced on her perfectly still spoon.

Other parents walked past her, eggs wobbling dangerously.

"This is so stupid," muttered someone's dad as his egg rolled off and splattered on the grass.

Mom's eye twitched. "Stupid? He moved too quickly. The angular momentum of his arm swing created a pendulum effect. Any first-year physics student could have predicted—"

"Mom. WALK."

She took one very slow, very careful step.

Then another.

Then froze again.

"The wind changed direction. I'm recalculating."

Mom came in last place.

But technically, her egg never fell.

---

The relay race was next. This one seemed safe. Just running. Just passing a baton. What could go wrong?

"Hop to it, everyone!" Coach Thompson called. "Get to your positions!"

Mom started hopping.

Actually hopping. Like a bunny.

"MOM. NO."

"He said hop to it. I'm hopping to it."

"It means HURRY!"

"This IS hurrying. Hopping is a form of locomotion."

"Just WALK. Please. Regular walking."

She looked disappointed but resumed normal bipedal movement.

The race started. Dad was first. He ran well—engineers are surprisingly athletic when they treat running as a physics equation.

Mom was second. She took the baton perfectly.

Then Coach Thompson yelled: "RUN LIKE THE WIND!"

Mom stopped.

"Linda?" Dad called. "Why did you stop?"

"Wind doesn't run." She looked around, confused. "Wind blows. It's the movement of air particles from high pressure to low pressure. It doesn't have legs. How can I run like something that doesn't run?"

"JUST RUN!"

"Should I blow? Is that what he means? Should I exhale forcefully while running?"

She started running again, but also breathing out really hard, like she was trying to blow up a balloon while sprinting.

"HWOOOOOOO! HWOOOOOOO!"

People stared.

A kid from the other team passed her easily.

Our team came in third.

---

Next up: the sack race.

"Hop along in those sacks!" the coordinator called. "First one to the finish line wins!"

Dad stared at his burlap sack.

"This is a sack."

"Yes."

"And we're racing."

"Yes."

"But you called it a sack race. Not a race while in sacks. A race for sacks. As in, competing to obtain sacks."

"Mr. Chen, please just get in the sack."

"But I already HAVE a sack. The race seems unnecessary if the prize is something I already possess."

I buried my face in my hands.

"Sweetheart," Mom called from her sack, "I believe we're meant to race WHILE INSIDE the sacks. It's a test of mobility under constrained conditions. Quite interesting from a biomechanics perspective."

"Ah!" Dad's face lit up. "A constraints-based competition! Why didn't you say so?"

He hopped into his sack.

They actually won this one. It turns out when you approach sack-hopping as a mathematical optimization problem involving center of gravity and thrust vectoring, you can really move.

"HOP HOP HOP!" Dad chanted, calculating angles mid-air. "Forty-three degrees! Compensate for wind resistance!"

"Peak thrust at the apex of each jump!" Mom added.

They crossed the finish line three full seconds before anyone else.

Coach Thompson was so surprised he just stared.

"That's... that's the fastest sack race I've ever seen."

"Thank you," Mom said, slightly out of breath. "We optimized our bounce coefficients."

---

Okay. Maybe this wasn't going as badly as I thought.

I mean, yes, there had been some awkward moments. Yes, my mom had stopped mid-race to debate the physics of wind. Yes, my dad had argued about sack ownership.

But we'd won TWO events!

Maybe we could get through this.

Then I heard Coach Thompson pick up his megaphone.

"ALRIGHT EVERYONE! LET'S HEAD TO THE FIELD EVENTS! I want you to LEAVE IT ALL ON THE FIELD! DIG DEEP! KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL!"

I looked at my parents.

They were already reaching for their pockets.

"Leave what on the field?" Mom asked.

"I don't have a shovel for digging," Dad added. "Do they provide shovels?"

The hope drained out of me.

We weren't even close to done.
