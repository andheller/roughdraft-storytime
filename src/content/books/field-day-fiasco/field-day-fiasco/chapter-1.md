# Chapter 1: The Careful Way

Most kids wake up and say, "I'm starving!"

I wake up and say, "I am experiencing hunger and would appreciate breakfast at your earliest convenience."

See, my parents take things literally. And I mean *literally* literally. Not the way people usually mean literally, which is actually figuratively. My parents hear words and those words mean exactly what they mean.

Nothing more. Nothing less. Nothing in between.

My name is Casey Chen. I'm ten years old. And I have learned The Careful Way.

This morning, I sat down at the breakfast table where Mom was reading a physics journal and Dad was sketching blueprints for something with way too many gears.

"Good morning," I said. "I slept adequately and am now ready to consume food."

"Wonderful," said Mom, not looking up. "Your cereal is in the cabinet. The milk is in the refrigerator. The bowl is—"

"I know where everything is, Mom."

"Just being precise."

Dad finally looked up from his blueprints. "Casey, your mother and I have exciting news."

My stomach dropped. In this house, "exciting news" could mean anything from "we bought a new calculator" to "we're building a hovercraft in the garage."

"We volunteered to help at your school's field day!" Mom beamed.

The spoon fell out of my hand.

"You... what?"

"Field day!" Dad said cheerfully. "Running, jumping, throwing things. Physical education in a festive atmosphere. It sounds delightful."

No. No no no no no.

"When did you volunteer?" I asked, trying to keep my voice calm.

"Yesterday. Principal Morrison said they needed parent helpers. We signed up immediately."

I gripped the edge of the table. Field day was TOMORROW. There was no time. No time to prepare. No time to create a comprehensive list of phrases to avoid. No time to warn them about—

"Casey?" Mom tilted her head. "Your face is doing something unusual. Are you experiencing digestive distress?"

"I'm fine," I squeaked. "Totally fine. Everything is fine."

That afternoon, I sat on my bed with a notebook and my best friend Malik on video chat.

"Just explain it to them," Malik said, munching chips. "Tell them not to say weird stuff."

"It's not that simple." I was already scribbling. "Do you know how many expressions people use in sports? Like, ALL of them. Break a leg. Kill it. Crush the competition."

"So?"

"So my dad will hear 'crush the competition' and start worrying about which children are being crushed!"

Malik snorted. "Your parents are hilarious."

"They're going to DESTROY me."

"See, that's exactly the kind of thing—"

"I KNOW!"

I looked at my list. It was already two pages long and growing.

**THINGS COACH THOMPSON WILL DEFINITELY SAY:**
- Break a leg
- Give it 110%
- Kill it out there
- Crush them
- Knock 'em dead
- Leave it all on the field
- Throw in the towel
- Hit it out of the park
- Dig deep
- Run like the wind

I groaned. This was impossible.

At dinner, I tried to prepare them.

"So," I said, pushing peas around my plate. "About field day tomorrow."

"We're very excited," Mom said. "I've prepared a spreadsheet of optimal hydration schedules."

"Great. That's... that's great. But here's the thing. Coach Thompson—he says things."

"Most people say things," Dad observed. "That's how communication works."

"No, I mean—he says *expressions*. Phrases that don't mean what they literally mean."

My parents exchanged confused looks.

"For example," I continued, "if he says 'break a leg,' he doesn't actually want anyone to break their leg. He's wishing them good luck."

"That's a very strange way to wish someone good luck," Mom said. "Why not simply say 'good luck'?"

"I don't know! It's just what people say!"

"Inefficient," Dad muttered.

"And if he says 'give it 110%,' he doesn't actually expect—"

"Well, of course not," Mom interrupted. "That's mathematically impossible. The maximum effort one can give is 100%. To suggest otherwise would violate basic principles of—"

"I KNOW. That's my point. People say it anyway. And I need you to just... go with it. Don't question it. Don't correct it. Just nod and smile."

My parents looked at each other again.

"We can do that," Dad said slowly. "Nod and smile. Even when people are mathematically incorrect."

"Or medically dangerous," Mom added.

"Or medically dangerous."

They both nodded seriously.

I wanted to believe them. I really did.

But I'd seen Dad try to "go with it" before. Last month, someone told him to "hold his horses" at the grocery store. He spent ten minutes looking for horses to hold.

Tomorrow was going to be a disaster.

I could feel it in my bones.

(Which, to be clear, is not a literal feeling. My bones feel normal. It's an expression.)

My parents would need that explained to them.

I added it to the list.
