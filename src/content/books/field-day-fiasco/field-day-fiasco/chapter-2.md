# Chapter 2: Coach Thompson Opens His Mouth

Field day morning arrived like a freight train of doom.

(Not an actual freight train. A metaphorical one. I'm getting good at these disclaimers.)

The field behind our school was transformed. Colorful flags flapped in the breeze. White lines marked racing lanes. Tables held ribbons and trophies and enough orange slices to feed an army.

And there, right in the middle of everything, stood Coach Thompson with his megaphone and his polo shirt and his endless, endless supply of expressions.

"ALRIGHT, EVERYONE!" he boomed. "GATHER 'ROUND!"

Students and parents shuffled toward him. I spotted Mom and Dad near the front, clipboards ready, matching sun hats on their heads. They'd arrived an hour early to "ensure optimal preparation."

I tried to catch their eye. *Remember what we talked about*, I thought desperately. *Nod and smile. Nod and smile.*

"Welcome to FIELD DAY!" Coach Thompson bellowed. "Today's the day we've been training for! Today we find out who's got what it takes!"

So far, so good. Nothing weird yet.

"Now, I know some of you are nervous. But I want you to know—you've GOT this."

Mom leaned toward Dad. "Got what?" I heard her whisper. "He didn't specify what they have."

Oh no.

"Just get out there and BREAK A LEG!"

Everything happened at once.

Mom's hand flew to her phone. "I'm calling 911."

"LINDA, NO!" I sprinted toward her, shoving past confused fourth-graders. "It's an expression! EXPRESSION!"

Dad was already looking around with concern. "Which leg? Whose leg? This seems like a serious liability issue."

"Nobody is breaking any legs!" I grabbed Mom's phone. "He means good luck! It means GOOD LUCK!"

Coach Thompson, completely oblivious, continued: "Now let's get out there and CRUSH THE COMPETITION!"

Mom's eyes went wide. "We will absolutely NOT be crushing any children."

"It's not real crushing!"

"Kevin, did he just instruct us to crush children?"

"It appears so. Should I contact the superintendent?"

Other parents were starting to stare. I could see my classmate Jordan's mom whispering to Jordan's dad. Great. Just great.

"Listen," I hissed, pulling my parents aside. "Crush means WIN. It means win REALLY WELL. Nobody is getting crushed. Nobody is getting broken. These are just WORDS."

Mom took a deep breath. "Okay. Okay. Words that don't mean what they mean. We discussed this. Nod and smile."

"Nod and smile," Dad repeated, nodding very seriously without smiling at all.

Coach Thompson's megaphone crackled again. "I want to see 110% out there today!"

The nodding stopped.

"That's mathematically—" Mom started.

"MATHEMATICALLY FINE," I said loudly. "IT'S FINE."

"But the very concept of percentage—"

"MOM."

She pressed her lips together. Dad was actually twitching.

"The maximum effort any individual can exert is, by definition, one hundred percent of their—"

"DAD. PLEASE."

Malik appeared beside me, grinning like this was the best day of his life. "This is amazing," he whispered. "This is the best field day ever."

"I hate you."

"LET'S KILL IT OUT THERE!" Coach Thompson roared.

Both my parents gasped.

"KILL?" Mom looked around frantically. "Kill WHAT? Kevin, he wants us to kill something!"

"Perhaps he means metaphorically kill our own limitations?" Dad offered hopefully.

"NOBODY IS KILLING ANYTHING!" I was definitely yelling now. Half the school was watching. "It means DO WELL! These are SPORTS EXPRESSIONS! They're NOT LITERAL!"

Coach Thompson finally seemed to notice the commotion. He lowered his megaphone.

"Everything okay over there?"

"Fine!" I called back, my voice cracking. "Everything's fine! Just clarifying some terminology!"

"That's the spirit! Keep your head in the game!"

Mom's hands flew to her head. "IN the game? How would one insert a head INTO a game? That seems anatomically—"

"EXPRESSION!" I grabbed both their arms. "Look. Just—just don't listen to anything Coach Thompson says. At all. Can you do that? Can you just pretend he's not speaking?"

"That seems rude," Dad said.

"It's not rude. It's SURVIVAL."

The whistle blew. The first event was starting.

Three-legged race.

I looked at my parents. They looked back at me. Somewhere behind us, Coach Thompson yelled about leaving everything on the field.

This was going to be a long day.

"The three-legged race!" an assistant announced. "Parents, find your partners!"

Mom and Dad stood next to each other, looking down at their legs.

"We already have four legs between us," Mom said thoughtfully. "That seems sufficient. Why would we need only three?"

"It's—" I couldn't even finish. "You know what? I'll explain after. Just... just go line up."

They walked toward the starting line, still discussing the mathematical inefficiency of reducing their collective leg count.

Malik patted my shoulder. "Hang in there, buddy."

"That's not a literal—"

"I know." He grinned. "I know."
