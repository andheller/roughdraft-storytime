# Chapter 4: Everything Falls Apart

"LEAVE IT ALL ON THE FIELD!"

The words echoed across the grass. And my parents—my sweet, literal, extremely thorough parents—did exactly what they were told.

Dad started emptying his pockets. Keys. Wallet. A small notebook. Three pens. A calculator. A tape measure (because you never know). A granola bar. A backup granola bar.

Mom removed her watch. Then her earrings. Then she started untucking her shirt.

"Mom. MOM. STOP."

"But Coach Thompson said to leave it ALL on the field. All implies everything. I'm being thorough."

"He means effort! He means leave all your EFFORT on the field!"

"That's not what he said."

"It's what he MEANT!"

Dad was now trying to remove his shoes. "Should I leave my socks too? He did say 'all.'"

"NOBODY NEEDS YOUR SOCKS, DAD!"

Other parents were definitely staring now. Jordan's mom had her phone out, filming. This was going to be on the school Facebook page by lunch.

"Kevin, Casey seems distressed." Mom squinted at me. "Your face is very red. Are you overheating? I have hydration schedules—"

"I'm not overheating. I'm EMBARRASSED."

"Embarrassed?" She looked genuinely confused. "Why? We're following instructions precisely."

I wanted to scream. I wanted to crawl into a hole. I wanted to be literally anywhere else on Earth.

But there was no time, because Coach Thompson was already shouting the next instruction.

"ALRIGHT, LONG JUMP! Keep your eye on the ball!"

There was no ball.

Dad immediately started looking around. "Where's the ball? He said to keep our eye on it, but I don't see—"

"There's no ball in long jump!"

"Then why did he mention a ball?"

"BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST SAY THINGS!"

But Dad wasn't listening. He'd found a kickball from the relay station. He picked it up. He pressed his eye directly against it.

"Am I doing this right?"

"Kevin, your glasses are in the way." Mom adjusted his face. "There. Now your cornea is making direct contact with the ball's surface."

"This seems unsanitary."

"It does. But those were the instructions."

I couldn't take it anymore. "THAT'S NOT—it means PAY ATTENTION! It means FOCUS! It doesn't mean LITERALLY PUT YOUR EYEBALL ON THE BALL!"

Dad pulled his face away. There was a red ring around his eye from pressing too hard.

"You could have mentioned that earlier."

Shot put was next. This required throwing a heavy metal ball as far as possible.

"DIG DEEP!" Coach Thompson encouraged. "SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT!"

Dad looked at the ground.

Then he started digging.

"Kevin, what are you doing?"

"He said dig deep." Dad was scooping dirt with his hands. Mom had already started on her own hole. "I assume there's something buried here? A prize perhaps? Treasure?"

"THERE'S NO TREASURE! IT MEANS TRY HARD!"

"Then why did he say dig? Casey, these expressions are extremely counterproductive. If he means 'try hard,' he should say 'try hard.' The reference to excavation is misleading at best."

"I KNOW. I KNOW! But normal people—"

I stopped.

The words hung in the air.

*Normal* people.

Mom and Dad both looked at me. Something shifted in their faces.

"Normal people?" Mom repeated quietly.

"I didn't mean—"

"No, that's... that's fine." She brushed dirt off her hands. "We understand. We're not normal."

"You wish we were normal," Dad added. He wasn't angry. He sounded... sad.

And suddenly I felt terrible.

"That's not what I—I just meant—"

"Casey." Mom put a hand on my shoulder. "We know we're different. We've always known. We process language differently. We see the world differently. We can't help it."

"We try," Dad said. "We really do. For you, we try to... nod and smile. Go with it. But sometimes we just hear the words as they are."

I looked at them—my weird, wonderful parents who'd shown up an hour early with hydration schedules. Who'd calculated bounce coefficients to win a sack race. Who'd pressed their eyeball against a ball because someone told them to.

They weren't trying to embarrass me.

They were just being themselves.

"I'm sorry," I said. "I didn't mean—"

"HEY!" Coach Thompson's megaphone blared. "Final event in ten minutes! TUG OF WAR! Everyone to the main field!"

Mom and Dad exchanged a look.

"Tug of... war?" Mom said slowly.

"War." Dad's face was serious. "That seems unnecessarily violent for an elementary school."

"Should we contact the authorities? War is a serious matter."

"Maybe we should talk to the principal—"

"It's just a rope!" I said quickly. "You pull a rope! Two teams pull a rope! It's not an actual war!"

They didn't look convinced.

"There are children here," Mom said. "If there's going to be combat—"

"No combat. Just rope."

"But he said WAR."

I took a deep breath.

"Okay," I said. "You know what? Never mind. You're right. The expressions are stupid. They don't make sense. 'Break a leg' is a weird thing to say. 'Dig deep' is confusing. 'Tug of war' does sound violent."

They stared at me.

"You're right," I continued. "You've always been right. Normal people just ignore how weird language is. But you don't. You listen to what people actually say. And maybe... maybe that's not so bad."

Mom blinked. "Are you feeling okay? Your face is still quite red."

"I'm fine." I grabbed both their hands. "Come on. Let's go pull a rope together. As a family. And if Coach Thompson says anything weird, we'll just... ignore him. Together."

Dad smiled. "That does sound nice."

"As a team," Mom agreed.

We walked toward the tug of war pit.

I had no idea what was about to happen.

But at least we'd face it together.
