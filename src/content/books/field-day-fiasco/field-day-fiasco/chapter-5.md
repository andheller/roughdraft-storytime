# Chapter 5: Hold Your Ground

The tug of war pit was chaos.

Parents lined up on both sides of a thick rope. Kids cheered from the sidelines. A mud puddle sat right in the middle, waiting for the losing team to get dragged through it.

Coach Thompson stood between the two sides, megaphone raised.

"ALRIGHT! This is it! The FINAL EVENT! The TUG! OF! WARRRR!"

Mom flinched at "war" but stayed in line. Progress.

Our team was a mix of parents and kids. Mom and Dad were near the back, right behind Malik's dad (who'd been laughing quietly all day and gave me a thumbs up).

The other team looked strong. Really strong. They had Mr. Patterson, who coached the high school wrestling team. And Mrs. Williams, who did CrossFit. And three dads who all looked like they bench-pressed cars for fun.

"We're going to lose," Malik whispered beside me.

"Probably."

"Your parents gonna do something weird?"

"Definitely."

He grinned. "Good."

Coach Thompson raised his hand. "Teams READY!"

Both sides grabbed the rope.

"On my whistle! Three! Two! One!"

*TWEEEEET!*

Both teams pulled. The rope went taut. Nobody moved.

"PULL!" Coach Thompson yelled. "PULL PULL PULL!"

Mr. Patterson was red-faced, muscles bulging. Mrs. Williams had her feet dug into the grass. Slowly—very slowly—our team started sliding toward the mud.

"COME ON!" Coach Thompson shouted. "DIG IN! HOLD YOUR GROUND!"

I saw Mom's eyes widen.

*Oh no.*

"HOLD YOUR GROUND!" he repeated. "DON'T GIVE AN INCH!"

Something changed in my parents' faces. The confusion disappeared. In its place was... understanding. Determination. Purpose.

They had received an instruction.

A very clear, very precise, very literal instruction.

*Hold your ground. Don't give an inch.*

Mom planted her feet. Not just planted—ANCHORED. She shifted her weight, found her center of gravity, and became a statue.

Dad did the same. His engineering brain was calculating angles, friction coefficients, optimal weight distribution. He bent his knees exactly 23 degrees (I could practically see him measuring it mentally).

They stopped moving.

Not just slowed down. STOPPED.

The rest of our team kept sliding, but Mom and Dad were frozen in place. Like someone had poured concrete around their feet.

Mr. Patterson pulled harder. The rope creaked. Our team slid another few inches.

But Mom and Dad didn't budge.

"What the—" Mr. Patterson grunted.

The rope was bending around my parents. They'd become an anchor point. A fixed position in space. The rest of our team was being dragged forward, but Mom and Dad had decided they were not moving, and so they were NOT. MOVING.

"HOLD THAT GROUND!" Coach Thompson bellowed.

"We are," Mom said calmly. "Precisely zero inches have been given."

"I've calculated the optimal resistance," Dad added, not even straining. "The force they're exerting is approximately 847 newtons. I'm counteracting with equal and opposite force. As Newton's Third Law dictates."

Other parents on our team started to rally. Malik's dad dug in behind my dad. Other parents found their footing. The backward slide stopped.

Then—slowly—we started pulling forward.

"WHAT'S HAPPENING?" someone on the other team yelled.

"I don't know!" Mr. Patterson was sweating now. "They're not moving! Why aren't they moving?!"

Coach Thompson was going nuts. "THAT'S IT! HOLD HOLD HOLD! DON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING!"

Mom looked at the inch of ground in front of her.

"I will not be giving anyone this ground. This is my ground. I am holding it."

She pulled.

Dad pulled.

Our whole team surged forward.

The other team stumbled. Mrs. Williams' sneakers lost traction. The CrossFit muscles couldn't compete with the sheer, stubborn, *literal* willpower of two parents who had been told to hold their ground and were going to hold it until the sun burned out.

"PULL!" someone on our team screamed.

"NOOOO!" someone on their team screamed.

And then—

*SPLOOSH!*

Mr. Patterson went face-first into the mud puddle. Then Mrs. Williams. Then all three bench-press dads. One by one, the other team toppled, dragged forward by momentum and mud and the unstoppable force of my parents' refusal to give an inch.

"WE WON!" Malik tackled me. "WE ACTUALLY WON!"

The crowd erupted. Kids swarmed the field. Our team dropped the rope, cheering.

Mom and Dad looked at each other.

"We held our ground," Mom said.

"Every inch of it," Dad confirmed.

"Well done."

"Thank you. You too."

They high-fived. It was the most robotic, precise high-five I'd ever seen.

It was perfect.

Later, after the ribbons were handed out and the orange slices were eaten and Coach Thompson declared it the "best field day in school history," I found my parents by the parking lot.

They were covered in dust. Mom's hydration schedule was crumpled. Dad had lost two of his three pens.

"Hey," I said.

"Hello," Mom said. "You seem less red than before."

"Yeah." I smiled. "I'm feeling better."

"We apologize for the confusion earlier. The expressions were—"

"Forget it." I hugged her. Then Dad. "You were amazing."

"We were?"

"You held your ground. You didn't give an inch. You won us the tug of war."

Mom and Dad exchanged looks.

"We just followed the instructions," Dad said.

"Precisely as stated," Mom added.

"I know." I grinned. "That's what made it work."

As we walked to the car, Malik ran up beside us.

"Dude! Your parents are LEGENDS! Did you see Patterson's face? Covered in mud! And your dad—he was like a ROBOT! An UNMOVABLE ROBOT!"

"Thanks?"

"I'm gonna tell EVERYONE. 'Casey's parents take everything literally and it's AWESOME!'"

He sprinted off.

Mom tilted her head. "Is being a 'legend' a positive thing? Legends are typically historical figures who—"

"It's positive, Mom."

"Ah. Good."

We got in the car. Dad started the engine.

"So," he said, "how was field day?"

I thought about it. The panic. The embarrassment. The hopping and the digging and my dad's eyeball pressed against a ball.

But also the sack race victory. The tug of war triumph. The way they'd held their ground—really, truly, literally held it—and won.

"It was good," I said.

And I meant it.

Literally.

### The End

*P.S. — Next week is the school spelling bee. Mom has already prepared a presentation on the history of English etymology and why silent letters are "orthographically dishonest."*

*I'm bringing earplugs.*

*But also... I can't wait.*
