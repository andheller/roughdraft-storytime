# Mr. Tarrant's Advice

The stranger came from the south.

Oliver was working in the garden when he heard the sound—not a crawler, but something smaller and lighter. He straightened up and shaded his eyes.

A man was walking across the valley, leading a small cart behind him. The cart was pulled by a four-legged machine that moved smoothly over the grass, not quite walking but not quite rolling either. Oliver had never seen anything like it.

Papa came out of the house. "Hello there!" he called.

The man raised a hand in greeting but didn't hurry. He walked at a steady pace, neither fast nor slow, like someone who knew exactly how long the journey would take and saw no point in rushing.

When he reached the house, Oliver could see him clearly. He was old—older than Papa, older than anyone Oliver had met since leaving the city. His face was weathered and lined, his hair gray and thin, his hands rough and scarred from years of work.

"Name's Tarrant," he said. "I farm about thirty kilometers south of here, in the old valley. Heard there were new families settling in this area. Thought I'd come see how you're getting on."

Mr. Tarrant didn't talk much, but when he did, people listened.

He walked the property with Papa, looking at everything—the house, the garden, the water system, the tool shed Marchman was building. He didn't compliment anything. He didn't criticize, either. He just looked, and nodded, and occasionally asked a question.

"How deep did you set your foundation?"

"Thirty centimeters."

"That'll do for now. Before winter, add another ten. Ground shifts when it freezes."

"Does it freeze here?"

"Sometimes. Not often. But when it does, you'll want those extra centimeters."

He looked at the garden, walking slowly between the rows. He bent down to examine the bean plants, feeling the leaves between his fingers. He dug a small hole near the carrots and looked at the soil.

"Who's been watering this?"

"My son, mostly," Papa said. "Oliver."

Mr. Tarrant grunted. "Good job. Even moisture, not too much. Most newcomers overwater."

Oliver felt a flush of pride. He hadn't even known you could overwater a garden.

That evening, Mr. Tarrant stayed for dinner.

He sat at the table Papa had built, eating slowly and steadily, not saying much while the food was in front of him. But after dinner, with a cup of tea in his hands, he began to talk.

"I've been in the eastern valleys for twenty-three years," he said. "Came out when I was younger than you." He nodded at Papa. "Different then. No terraforming crews, no survey stakes. You just found a piece of land and started working."

"What was it like?" Mama asked.

"Hard. Lonely. My wife and I lost our first crop to a fungus we'd never seen before. Lost the second crop to drought. Third year, we figured it out. Started keeping records of what worked and what didn't. By the fifth year, we were feeding ourselves and having extra to trade."

"Trade with who?"

"Other settlers, at first. Then the supply convoys started coming through. Now there's a market town about sixty kilometers east. You can sell your surplus there and buy things you can't make yourself."

Oliver listened carefully. He hadn't thought about what would happen after this first year—how they would get the things they couldn't grow or build. It was another piece of the puzzle he hadn't known was missing.

---

After dinner, Oliver was clearing dishes when Mr. Tarrant spoke to him directly.

"You're the one keeping the garden records?"

"Yes, sir."

"Show me."

Oliver fetched his notebook from his room. His hands were sweating. He didn't know why—it was just a notebook, just numbers and drawings. But something about Mr. Tarrant made him want to do well.

Mr. Tarrant took the notebook and turned through the pages slowly. He looked at the moisture readings, the growth observations, the drawings of seedlings at different stages. He didn't say anything for a long time.

"How old are you?" he finally asked.

"Nine."

Mr. Tarrant nodded. "When I was nine, I didn't know enough to keep records. Took me until I was thirty to figure out how important it was." He handed the notebook back. "You keep doing this. Every day, every season, every year. In ten years, you'll know this land better than anyone."

"Really?"

"Land has patterns. Weather, soil, plants—they all have patterns. The patterns change slowly, so slow you can't see them in one season or even one year. But if you write it all down, and you look back over years, you start to see things. When the dry spells come. When the wet spells come. Which plants do well and which struggle. That knowledge is worth more than money."

Oliver looked at his notebook with new eyes. It wasn't just a record of what had happened. It was a way of understanding the future.

The next morning, Mr. Tarrant walked the property again.

This time, Oliver went with him. The old man moved slowly, stopping often to look at things—a patch of native plants growing near the river, a bird's nest in a low tree, the way the ground sloped near the south boundary.

"What do you see there?" he asked Oliver, pointing at the ground.

Oliver looked. It was just grass, as far as he could tell. "Nothing special."

"Look at the color. See how it's darker there?"

Now that he looked carefully, Oliver could see it—a strip of grass that was slightly darker green than the grass around it.

"That means water," Mr. Tarrant said. "Underground. Probably an old stream bed that dried up thousands of years ago. The water's still there, just deeper now. If you ever need a well, drill there."

"How do you know that?"

"Experience. I've seen it before, in other valleys. The patterns repeat."

They walked on. Mr. Tarrant pointed out other things—a type of bush that grew where the soil was rich, a kind of grass that only appeared in sandy areas, the way animals left trails through the vegetation when they came to drink from the river.

"The land tells you what it needs," Mr. Tarrant said. "You just have to learn how to listen."

---

Before Mr. Tarrant left, he gave Papa a list.

"Things you need before winter," he said. "Extra insulation for the house. Backup power cells in case the solar panels get buried in snow. A root cellar for storing vegetables. And talk to the other families—pool your resources, help each other. Nobody survives out here alone."

"Thank you," Papa said. "We appreciate you taking the time."

"Self-interest," Mr. Tarrant said. "More families means more trade. More trade means we all do better." He paused. "Also, it's lonely being the only ones out here. Nice to have neighbors, even if they're thirty kilometers away."

He shook hands with Papa and Mama, nodded to Oliver and Thea, and began walking back the way he had come, the little cart rolling behind him.

Oliver watched until he disappeared over the southern hills.

That night, Oliver added a new section to his notebook.

*Things I learned from Mr. Tarrant:*

He wrote down everything he could remember—about the underground water, the dark grass, the bush that meant rich soil. He wrote about the importance of keeping records, about learning to read the land, about the patterns that only showed themselves over years.

At the bottom, he added:

*"You keep records. Good. That's how you learn what works."*

He underlined it twice.

Then he turned to a fresh page and wrote the date at the top. Tomorrow he would add more observations. And the day after that. And the day after that.

In ten years, Mr. Tarrant had said, he would know this land better than anyone.

Oliver was going to make sure that was true.
