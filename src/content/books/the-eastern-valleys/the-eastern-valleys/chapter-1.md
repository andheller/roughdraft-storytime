# Forty Hectares

The letter came on a Tuesday.

Papa held it up for Mama to see, and Mama put her hand over her mouth the way she did when something was too big for words. Oliver knew what it meant before anyone told him. Three years they had waited. Three years of Papa checking the network every morning, hoping their name would come up on the settlement list.

"Forty hectares," Papa said. "In the eastern valleys. Ours."

Thea looked up from where she was building a tower out of blocks. "What's a hector?"

"Hectare," Oliver said. He had looked it up once, after Papa first put their name on the list. "It's a piece of land. A hundred meters by a hundred meters. And we're getting forty of them."

Thea knocked over her tower. "Is that big?"

"It's bigger than anything we've ever had," Papa said.

Oliver tried to imagine it. Their apartment had three rooms—a kitchen, a bedroom for Mama and Papa, and a smaller room he shared with Thea. The hallway outside their door was twelve meters long. He had measured it once, walking heel to toe. A hundred meters was more than eight of those hallways. And they were getting forty squares that size.

"When do we go?" Thea asked. She was already up, pulling at Papa's sleeve.

Papa looked at Mama. Mama looked back at him. Something passed between them that Oliver didn't quite understand—something about being scared and excited at the same time.

"Soon," Papa said. "Before the planting season starts. We'll need time to build."

That night, Papa showed them the survey images on the kitchen screen. Oliver pulled his chair close and studied them carefully.

The land was brown and flat, stretching toward green hills in the distance. A river ran along one edge, silver and winding. There were no buildings, no roads, no other people—just the land and the sky and tiny marker stakes showing where their property began and ended.

"The terraforming crews finished last spring," Papa explained. "The soil's been treated. The air's been balanced. Everything's ready for families to come and build."

"Where will our house be?" Oliver asked.

Papa pointed to a spot near the river. "I'm thinking here. Close to water, with good drainage. We'll have the fields behind us, and room to expand if we need to."

"I want a window that faces the river," Thea said.

"You can have any window you want," Papa told her. "We're building this house ourselves. We get to decide everything."

Oliver stared at the image. It was hard to believe that flat brown rectangle would become their home. Right now it was just dirt and stakes and possibility.

The next weeks were full of work. Papa sold their furniture—they couldn't take it in the crawler, and besides, Papa said he would build new furniture when they got there. Mama sorted through their clothes and belongings, deciding what to keep and what to leave behind.

"You can each bring one box of things," Mama told Oliver and Thea. "Choose carefully."

Oliver thought about this for a long time. His room was small, but it was full of things he cared about. His books, his rock collection, the model crawler he had built from a kit, the drawings he had made of plants and animals from his schoolwork.

In the end, he packed his three favorite books, his best rocks, a small notebook and two pencils, and a photograph of their family taken when he was five and Thea was two. The model crawler wouldn't fit, so he took it apart carefully and saved only the wheels—Papa might need spare parts.

Thea's box was easier. She filled it with her dolls and a blanket and a small music player that had belonged to Grandmother.

The crawler arrived on a gray morning two weeks before they were scheduled to leave. A man drove it to their building and handed Papa the keys.

"She's old," the man said, "but she runs well. Good luck out there."

Oliver followed Papa outside to look at it. The crawler was big—bigger than their apartment, with six heavy wheels and a canvas cover stretched over the back. The sides were dented and scratched from years of use, but the wheels looked solid and the engine hummed steadily when Papa started it.

"This will be our home for the journey," Papa said. "Six hundred kilometers. About two weeks if the weather holds."

Oliver walked around the crawler slowly, looking at everything. There were storage compartments built into the sides, a solar array folded on top, and a small step-ladder leading up to the covered back where they would sleep.

"Can I go inside?" he asked.

"Go ahead."

Oliver climbed the step-ladder and pushed through the canvas flap. Inside, the crawler was dim and smelled like old canvas and machine oil. There were benches along both sides that folded down into beds, hooks for hanging things, and small windows cut into the canvas walls. It wasn't pretty, but it was solid and practical.

He sat on one of the benches and tried to imagine living here for two weeks. Eating here. Sleeping here. Watching the world change outside those small windows as they traveled toward their new home.

The robots came out of storage the day before they left.

Marchman was big. Taller than Papa, broader than the doorway. He had to duck and turn sideways to fit into their apartment. His body was gray metal, scratched and worn from years of work. He had four arms—two heavy ones for lifting and two smaller ones for fine work—and a flat, patient face with simple sensor lights where eyes would be.

Papa had owned Marchman for twelve years, since before Oliver was born. Marchman had helped Papa with his maintenance work in the city, lifting heavy machinery, holding things steady, doing the jobs that were too hard or too dangerous for a person alone.

Marchman didn't speak. He didn't need to. He listened to instructions and he worked. That was what he was built for.

Penny was different.

She was smaller than Marchman, about Mama's height, with a rounder body and clever hands that had dozens of tiny tools folded into them. Her face was more expressive than Marchman's—she could tilt her head, raise her sensor plates like eyebrows, move in ways that felt almost human.

Penny had belonged to Mama's family. She had been there when Mama was a girl, helping in the kitchen, mending clothes, teaching Mama how to bake bread and preserve food and fix things that broke.

"Penny taught me everything I know about keeping a house," Mama told Oliver once. "She's patient. She explains things well. She never gets frustrated when you make mistakes."

Now Penny stood in their small kitchen, her head tilted slightly as she looked around at the boxes and bags and empty spaces where furniture used to be.

"It will be good to have land again," Mama said to her quietly. "Real soil. Real sunlight. Not just grow-lights and hydroponics."

Penny hummed softly. It was a sound she made when she was thinking, or when she agreed with something. Oliver had heard that hum all his life. It was a comforting sound.

---

The morning they left, Oliver woke before dawn.

He lay in his bunk and listened to the quiet sounds of the apartment—Thea breathing below him, the soft whir of the air recycler, the distant rumble of the city outside. He had slept in this room for nine years. He knew every crack in the ceiling, every squeak of the floor, every way the light came through the window at different times of day.

After today, he would never sleep here again.

He got up quietly and walked through the apartment. It looked strange now—empty and echoing, the walls bare, the floors scuffed where furniture used to sit. It didn't look like home anymore. It looked like a place where someone used to live.

Papa found him standing in the kitchen.

"Nervous?" Papa asked.

Oliver nodded.

Papa put his hand on Oliver's shoulder. "That's all right. I'm nervous too. Your mother is nervous. But we wanted this, Oliver. We've been waiting for this. And we're going to build something good out there. Something that's ours."

"What if it's too hard?"

"It will be hard," Papa said. "But hard isn't the same as bad. Hard just means it matters. The things worth having are usually hard to get."

---

They loaded the last boxes into the crawler as the sun came up. Marchman lifted the heavy crates—seeds, tools, the water recycler, bolts of cloth, the solar panels they would need for the house. Penny packed the smaller things carefully, making sure nothing would shift or break during the journey.

Neighbors came out to watch. Some of them waved. A few came to say goodbye and wish them luck. Oliver didn't know most of them well—in the city, people lived close together but didn't always know each other.

Finally, everything was loaded. Papa climbed into the driver's seat. Mama sat beside him. Oliver and Thea climbed into the back, finding spots on the benches among the boxes and bags.

Marchman and Penny would walk alongside the crawler. They didn't need to ride—they didn't get tired the way people did. And walking saved power in the crawler's batteries, power they might need later.

"Everyone ready?" Papa called back.

"Ready!" Thea shouted.

Oliver just nodded. His throat felt tight.

Papa started the engine. The crawler hummed and vibrated. Slowly, it began to roll forward.

Oliver looked out the small back window as they pulled away. He watched their building get smaller. He watched the familiar streets slide past. He watched the city that had been his whole world begin to disappear behind them.

For a moment, he wanted to call out, to tell Papa to stop, to say he had changed his mind. This was too big, too scary, too much.

But then he remembered what Papa had said. Hard isn't the same as bad.

He turned around and faced forward, looking through the canvas flap at the road ahead. Somewhere out there, six hundred kilometers away, forty hectares were waiting.

He didn't look back again.
