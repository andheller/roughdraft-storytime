# The Harvest

The tomatoes ripened on a morning in late autumn.

Oliver found them when he went to check the garden, as he did every morning. The plants were heavy with fruit now—green tomatoes turning to orange, orange turning to red. And there, on the highest vine, were three tomatoes that had finally reached the deep, perfect red that meant they were ready.

He picked them carefully, cradling them in his hands. They were warm from the sun, smooth and heavy. He brought them inside and set them on the kitchen table.

Mama looked at them for a long moment. Then she smiled.

"Our first harvest," she said.

After that, the harvesting didn't stop.

Every day brought something new. Beans came down from their vines, filling baskets and buckets. Carrots emerged from the earth, orange and sweet. Squash grew fat on their stems, yellow and green and striped. The lettuce they had planted after the storm was finally ready, crisp and tender.

Oliver worked in the garden every morning and evening, picking what was ripe, checking what was almost ready, recording everything in his notebook. His hands were stained green and brown from the work. His back ached from bending. But every time he carried a full basket into the house, he felt a satisfaction deeper than anything he had felt before.

This food had come from the ground—ground he had prepared, seeds he had planted, plants he had watered and weeded and cared for. Every vegetable was proof that they had done something real. That they had made something from nothing.

The other families were harvesting too.

Oliver walked with Emeka to the Okonkwo garden one afternoon and found the whole family picking beans. Even little Ada was helping, carrying a small basket that kept getting too heavy for her.

"Look at this," Emeka said, holding up a bean pod as long as his hand. "We didn't think they'd grow after the storm. But they came back bigger than before."

"Plants are tough," Oliver said. "Penny told me that. They can recover from a lot, as long as the roots are healthy."

"My father says we'll have enough to save some for next year's planting. And enough to trade at the market."

The market—Oliver had almost forgotten about it. Mr. Tarrant had mentioned it months ago, but it had seemed so far away then. Now it was real. They would take their extra vegetables to a town sixty kilometers east and trade them for things they couldn't grow or make.

They were becoming real farmers.

Mama preserved everything she could.

She had learned from Penny years ago how to dry vegetables, pickle them, store them in ways that would keep through the winter. Now she taught Oliver and Thea, working in the kitchen with jars and salt and the big drying racks that Papa had built.

"Tomatoes go in jars," Mama explained, showing Oliver how to pack them tight. "Covered with oil, sealed properly, they'll last until spring. Beans we dry—spread them out on the racks and let the air do the work. Carrots and squash go in the root cellar, where it's cool and dark."

"Why do we have to save so much?" Thea asked. "We can just grow more next year."

"Next year's planting doesn't happen until spring. That's five months away. And we don't know what next year's weather will be like. Maybe there will be drought, or another storm, or something we haven't even imagined. If we save enough now, we'll be safe no matter what comes."

Oliver understood. It was like what Mr. Tarrant had said about keeping records—the future was uncertain, and the way you prepared for it was by being careful and thorough now.

When the last vegetables had been picked and the garden stood empty for winter, the families gathered at Valley House to celebrate.

It wasn't just a dinner. It was a feast.

Every family brought their best dishes, made from food they had grown themselves. Mrs. Okonkwo made a bean stew with herbs from her garden. Mrs. Lindgren baked bread from wheat they had traded for at the market. The Vasquezes brought roasted squash with honey. The Henrys made a salad of greens so fresh they had been picked that morning.

And Mama brought tomatoes—those same tomatoes Oliver had harvested weeks ago, now cooked into a rich red sauce that covered pasta Mr. Tarrant had brought from his own stores.

"This is amazing," Emeka said, his mouth full. "I could eat this forever."

Oliver nodded, but he wasn't really listening. He was looking around the room—at the long tables covered with food, at the families laughing and talking, at the lanterns casting warm light over everything.

This was real. This was happening.

Six months ago, they had arrived in an empty valley with nothing but a crawler full of supplies and the hope that they could build a life here. Now look at them. Houses stood on the ridges. Gardens lay fallow for winter, ready to be planted again in spring. Children played together like they had known each other all their lives.

They had done it. They had really done it.

---

After dinner, the music started.

Papa got out his concertina, and Mr. Lindgren surprised everyone by producing a violin he had kept hidden in his crawler. Mrs. Parkinson, it turned out, could sing—not beautifully, but with enough enthusiasm that everyone joined in.

The songs were old ones, songs from Earth, songs that had been carried across space by settlers generations ago. Oliver didn't know all the words, but he hummed along, watching the adults dance and the children run in circles and the robots stand patiently in the corners, part of the celebration in their own way.

Penny caught his eye and tilted her head—that gesture that meant she was pleased.

"Happy?" she asked.

"Yeah," Oliver said. "I think so."

"Good. You worked hard for this. You should enjoy it."

---

Later, when the music had stopped and people were saying goodnight, Oliver walked outside.

The night was cold and clear. Both moons were high, the blue one and the amber one, casting double shadows across the valley. He could see the lights of the other houses—the Okonkwos, the Lindgrens, all the families going home after the celebration.

He stood there for a long time, just looking.

The house on the ridge behind him—he had helped build that. The garden, lying quiet in the moonlight—he had planted those seeds, watered those plants, saved them from the storm. The community gathering in Valley House—he had been part of that too, part of building it, part of making it matter.

This was home now.

Not the city. Not the apartment where he had lived for nine years. Not anywhere he had been before.

Here. This valley. This land. These people.

Home.

Papa found him outside.

"Cold night," Papa said.

"I know. I just... wanted to look."

Papa nodded. He stood beside Oliver, looking out at the same view—the dark valley, the silver river, the scattered lights of the settlement.

"Do you remember what I told you, the morning we left the city?" Papa asked.

Oliver thought back. It felt like a lifetime ago. "You said hard isn't the same as bad."

"That's right. And you know what? It's been hard. Harder than I expected, some days. But looking at this..." Papa gestured at the valley, at everything they had built. "I wouldn't trade it for anything."

"Me neither," Oliver said.

They stood together in the cold, father and son, looking at the home they had made.

After a while, Mama called them inside. There was hot tea and warm blankets and the comfortable smallness of their own house, the house they had built together, the house that held everything they needed.

Oliver went to sleep that night feeling something he hadn't felt since they left the city.

Complete.

Like all the pieces of his life had finally come together, and everything was exactly where it was supposed to be.

Outside, the moons traced their slow arcs across the sky. The valley slept. And spring, with all its new beginnings, was only a few months away.
