# Stakes in the Ground

The first night on their land, they slept in the crawler.

It felt strange. They had slept in the crawler every night for two weeks, but this was different. This time, the ground beneath the wheels was theirs. This time, when Oliver looked out the window, he wasn't looking at a campsite they would leave in the morning. He was looking at home.

He woke before dawn and lay still, listening.

The sounds were different here. No city noise, no machine hum from distant factories. Just wind in the grass, insects chirping, and somewhere far off, a bird calling a song he didn't recognize.

He climbed out of his bunk quietly, not wanting to wake Thea, and pushed through the canvas flap into the cool morning air.

The sky was turning pink at the edges. Mist hung low over the valley, making everything soft and dreamlike. Oliver could see the river in the distance, a silver ribbon through the fog. He could see the hills rising on the far side, dark shapes against the brightening sky.

And he could see the land. Their land. Stretching out in every direction, waiting for them.

After breakfast, Papa gathered everyone together.

"Today we survey," he said. "We need to understand exactly what we have. The maps are helpful, but maps don't tell you everything. We need to walk the ground ourselves."

They split up. Mama and Thea would inventory their supplies and organize the crawler for an extended stay. Penny would begin testing the soil in different areas—checking for nutrients, drainage, anything that might affect where they built and planted.

Papa, Oliver, and Marchman would walk the property boundaries.

"Four hundred meters on each side," Papa said, checking the survey documents on his handpad. "We'll follow the stakes. It'll take most of the morning."

Oliver had walked four hundred meters before. It was the distance from their apartment building to the market square in the city—a ten-minute walk, nothing special.

But that was on pavement, in straight lines, with buildings blocking the view. Out here, four hundred meters felt different. The land rolled and dipped. There were no straight lines. And when you could see everything, distances played tricks on you.

They found the first stake at the corner of their property.

It was a simple metal post, about knee-high, with a number stamped into the top. The survey crews had placed these markers years ago, when they first mapped out the parcels for settlement. They marked where one family's land ended and another's began.

Papa knelt and brushed dirt away from the base. "Still solid," he said. "Good. We'll need to put in permanent markers eventually, but these will do for now."

They walked along the northern boundary, following the line of stakes. Marchman carried the equipment—a surveyor's rod, a measuring tape, a small device for checking elevation. Oliver's job was to write down the numbers Papa called out.

"Seventeen meters," Papa said, sighting along the rod. "Slope grade two percent. Ground cover mixed grass and native shrub."

Oliver wrote it all in his notebook. He wasn't sure what all the numbers meant yet, but Papa said understanding the land was the first step to working it.

The walking was harder than Oliver expected. The grass was knee-high in places, hiding rocks and holes. His legs ached. His boots got wet from morning dew. But every time he looked up and saw the land stretching out around them—their land—he forgot about being tired.

At the eastern corner, they stopped to rest.

From here, Oliver could see the Glass River clearly. It curved along the edge of their property, sparkling in the sunlight. He could see the far bank where they had camped, and beyond it, the path they had taken through the hills.

"The river's our eastern boundary," Papa explained. "Natural borders are good. They don't move, and everyone knows where they are."

"What about the other sides?" Oliver asked.

"Stakes and agreements. Eventually there will be neighbors on all sides, and we'll put in fences or hedges or walls. For now, it's just us."

Oliver looked west, where their land continued toward the green hills. Somewhere out there, beyond the hills, were other valleys, other settlers, other families starting their own lives. But right now, looking at the empty grass, it felt like they were the only people in the world.

The southern boundary followed a slight ridge.

Papa said the ridge was good for building. Water would drain away instead of pooling. The ground was solid underneath. They could see the whole property from up here.

"This is where the house will go," Papa decided. "Close to the river for water, up on the ridge for drainage, facing east to catch the morning sun."

He paced out a rectangle in the grass—eight meters by twelve meters. Not big, but enough for a family of four. Room to grow later if they needed it.

"This is the kitchen," Papa said, pointing. "This is the main room. Back here, bedrooms. And over here"—he walked to the corner closest to the river—"a covered porch where we can sit in the evenings and watch the sunset."

Oliver tried to see it. Right now there was just grass and dirt and sky. But Papa saw something more. Papa saw walls and windows and a place where they would live.

"When do we start building?" Oliver asked.

"Tomorrow. Today, we mark the corners. Then we dig the foundation."

That afternoon, Papa showed Oliver how to set a proper stake.

"The survey stakes are just markers," Papa explained. "They tell you where the boundaries are. Building stakes are different. They tell you exactly where every wall will go. They have to be precise."

He handed Oliver a heavy wooden stake, sharpened to a point at one end. It was heavier than it looked.

"The corner stakes are the most important," Papa said. "Everything else is measured from them. If the corners are wrong, the whole house will be wrong."

Marchman had already dug the first hole—a narrow shaft about half a meter deep, punched straight down through the grass and into the brown soil beneath. Papa set the stake in the hole and held it steady.

"Check that it's straight," he told Oliver.

Oliver stepped back and looked. The stake tilted slightly to the left. He told Papa, and Papa adjusted it.

"Now check from the other direction."

Oliver walked around to the other side. Straight. He nodded.

"Good. Now we pack the soil around it."

They worked together, filling the hole with dirt and tamping it down tight. When they finished, the stake stood solid and true, marking the spot where the northeast corner of their house would be.

Papa looked at Oliver. "Want to do the next one yourself?"

Oliver's heart jumped. "Really?"

"Really. I'll tell you if you're doing it wrong. But I think you're ready."

---

The second stake was harder.

Oliver's arms shook holding it in place. The hole wasn't quite straight, so he had to adjust the stake angle to compensate. Twice Papa told him to check his measurements again. Once he packed the soil too loosely and had to start over.

But finally, finally, the stake was set. Solid. Straight. True.

Papa checked it from every angle. He used the measuring tape to verify the distance from the first stake. He sighted along the line with the surveyor's rod.

"Perfect," he said.

Oliver looked at the stake. It was just a piece of wood stuck in the ground. But it was his piece of wood, his stake, the corner of the house he was going to live in.

He had helped build something. Something real.

That evening, Mama made supper over a fire while Papa and Marchman set the other two corner stakes.

Oliver sat by the fire and watched the flames. He was exhausted—his arms hurt, his back hurt, his legs hurt from all the walking. But it was a good kind of exhaustion. The kind that came from doing something that mattered.

Penny came and sat beside him. She had spent the day testing soil samples, cataloging data, preparing for the planting that would come later.

"How was your day?" she asked.

"I set a stake," Oliver said. "By myself. Well, mostly by myself."

"I saw." Penny's head tilted slightly. "You did well."

"Papa said it was perfect."

"It was. I measured it while you were eating. One point three centimeters off the ideal position. Well within tolerance."

Oliver laughed. One point three centimeters. On forty hectares, that was nothing.

"Penny," he said, "do you think we can really do this? Build a house, grow food, make a life out here?"

Penny was quiet for a moment. When she spoke, her voice was soft.

"I have been with your mother's family for forty-seven years," she said. "I have seen them fail at things. I have seen them succeed at things. What I have learned is this: the families that succeed are not the ones who never have problems. They are the ones who don't give up when problems come."

She looked out at the dark valley, at the stars beginning to appear overhead.

"Your family doesn't give up. So yes, Oliver. I think you can do this."

Oliver nodded. He didn't have anything to say to that. But he felt it, deep in his chest—a warmth that wasn't from the fire.

Tomorrow they would start digging the foundation. The day after, they would start building walls. And someday, maybe sooner than he could imagine, they would have a house.

A real house. On their own land. Built with their own hands.

He couldn't wait.
