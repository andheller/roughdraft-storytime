# Neighbors

Oliver saw the crawler first.

He was checking the garden sensors when a flash of movement caught his eye—something moving on the road that led down from the western hills. He shaded his eyes and squinted.

A crawler. Coming this way.

"Papa!" he called. "Someone's coming!"

Papa came out of the house, wiping his hands on a rag. He had been building a table—their first real piece of furniture. He looked where Oliver was pointing.

"Well," Papa said slowly. "Looks like we're not alone anymore."

The Okonkwo family arrived at midday.

Their crawler was newer than the Aldridges'—bigger, with a metal cover instead of canvas. A man drove, with a woman beside him. Oliver could see faces in the windows of the back—children, watching as their parents guided the crawler down into the valley.

Oliver hung back as Papa walked out to meet them.

In the city, meeting new people hadn't mattered much. You passed strangers on the street every day. If you didn't like someone, you just avoided them. There were always other people.

Out here, things were different. These would be their neighbors—probably their only neighbors for a long time. What if Oliver didn't like them? What if they didn't like him?

He felt his stomach twist.

"Come on," Mama said, putting a hand on his shoulder. "Let's go say hello."

---

The man's name was Mr. Okonkwo. He was tall and serious-looking, with a deep voice and a firm handshake. The woman was Mrs. Okonkwo, smaller than her husband but with quick eyes that seemed to notice everything.

"We've been watching your smoke for days," Mr. Okonkwo said. "We knew someone was here. Good to finally meet you."

"How was your journey?" Papa asked.

"Long. The river was high—we almost had to wait a week for it to go down. But we made it."

The adults talked about the route, the roads, the weather. Oliver half-listened, but his attention was on the crawler, where the Okonkwo children were climbing out.

There were three of them. A tall boy, maybe twelve. A girl about Thea's age, with braided hair and a bright dress. And another boy, somewhere between them, who jumped down from the crawler and immediately started looking around.

He had a restless energy about him—his head turning this way and that, his feet moving even when he was standing still. He spotted Oliver watching and came straight over.

"I'm Emeka," he said. "We're going to live next door. Well, not next door like in the city. But our land touches yours. My father showed me on the map."

"I'm Oliver."

"Have you been here long? Is it hard? Do you have animals yet? Have you seen any wild ones? My sister said there are animals with four eyes here but I don't believe her. Are there?"

Oliver blinked. Emeka talked fast—faster than anyone Oliver had ever met. Before he could answer one question, there were three more.

"We've been here about a month," Oliver said. "And I haven't seen any four-eyed animals."

"Ha! I knew she was making it up. What about the river? Is it really as clear as they say? My father said you can see straight to the bottom. Is that true?"

"Yes. It's called the Glass River."

"Can we go see it? Right now? I've been sitting in that crawler for so long, I need to move."

Oliver looked at Mama, who nodded.

"Go ahead," she said. "But stay where I can see you."

---

Emeka didn't stop talking the whole way to the river.

He talked about the city they had left, which was different from Oliver's city—bigger, older, with a different name. He talked about the journey, and how boring it was, and how his little sister had cried every night for the first week. He talked about his father's plans for their land, and his mother's plans for a garden, and his older brother's plans to catch fish in the river.

"What are your plans?" Emeka asked suddenly.

Oliver thought about it. "I don't know. Help my parents, I guess. Learn how things work."

"That's not a plan. That's just... doing whatever you're told."

"Is there something wrong with that?"

Emeka shrugged. "I don't know. I just like having my own plans. Things I want to do that aren't about anybody else."

They reached the river. Emeka dropped to his knees and stuck his hand in the water.

"Cold!" he said. "And you're right, you can see everything. Look at those fish! I'm going to catch one. My brother thinks he's going to be the fisherman, but I'm going to catch one first. You'll see."

Oliver sat on a rock and watched Emeka splash around in the shallows, making so much noise that every fish for a hundred meters probably fled. He couldn't decide if Emeka was annoying or exciting. Maybe both.

That night, both families ate together.

They set up tables outside, between the two crawlers—the Okonkwos hadn't started building yet, so they were still living in theirs. Mama and Mrs. Okonkwo combined their supplies, and together they made a real meal: fresh bread, rehydrated vegetables, even a sweet pudding that Mrs. Okonkwo had been saving for a special occasion.

"To new neighbors," Papa said, raising his cup.

"To the eastern valleys," Mr. Okonkwo replied.

They clinked cups and drank.

Oliver sat with the Okonkwo children. Emeka's older brother, who was named Samuel, was quiet and serious, like his father. Emeka's younger sister, who was named Ada, immediately attached herself to Thea, and the two of them ran off to look at flowers.

"Your house looks good," Samuel said, nodding toward the building on the ridge. "How long did it take?"

"About two weeks," Oliver said. "My father and Marchman—that's our workerbot—did most of the heavy work. But everyone helped."

"We'll need to start building soon. Before the rainy season."

"There's a rainy season?"

Samuel looked at him. "You didn't know? In about six weeks, the rains come. They last for a month, maybe more. If you don't have a roof by then, everything gets wet."

Oliver hadn't known that. He wondered what else he didn't know about this land.

After dinner, Emeka grabbed Oliver's arm.

"Come on," he said. "I want to see where our land meets yours."

They walked west, toward the hills, following the property stakes. The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of red and gold. The grass rippled in the evening breeze.

"Here," Emeka said, stopping at a stake. "This is our corner. And that"—he pointed to another stake, about twenty meters away—"is yours. Everything in between is the boundary."

Oliver looked at the line of stakes stretching away into the distance. On one side, his family's land. On the other side, Emeka's.

"We're neighbors," Emeka said. "Really neighbors. Not like in the city, where there's a wall between you and you never see each other."

"Yeah."

"I'm going to build a path here. From my house to yours. So we can visit whenever we want."

Oliver smiled. He hadn't thought about that—about being able to walk to a friend's house, any time, without asking permission or scheduling or any of the complicated things that visiting people in the city required.

"I'd like that," he said.

Emeka grinned. "Good. Because I don't know anybody else out here, and you seem all right. A little quiet, but all right."

"You talk enough for both of us."

Emeka laughed—a loud, sudden laugh that echoed across the empty valley. "That's true. My mother says I could talk the ears off a statue. But that's just how I think, you know? Out loud."

Oliver didn't know. He did his thinking on the inside, in his notebook, in the quiet moments when no one else was around. But maybe that was okay. Maybe two people didn't have to be the same to be friends.

---

They walked back as the stars came out.

The two moons were rising—one pale blue, one amber—casting strange double shadows across the grass. In the distance, Oliver could see the lights of both houses: his family's house on the ridge, and the glow of the Okonkwo crawler below.

"Tomorrow I'll help you scout for a building site," Oliver said. "I know where the best ground is. Papa and I surveyed the whole area."

"Really? You'd do that?"

"Sure. That's what neighbors do, right? Help each other."

Emeka nodded slowly. "In the city, neighbors didn't help each other much. Everybody was too busy, my father said. Too worried about their own problems."

"Maybe it's different out here."

"Maybe." Emeka looked at the empty valley, at the two small points of light in the darkness. "Maybe when there's only a few of you, you have to look out for each other. Because there's no one else to do it."

Oliver thought about that as they walked. No one else to do it. In the city, there were always other people—police, doctors, repair crews, everyone you needed just a call away. Out here, it was just them.

But maybe that wasn't scary. Maybe it was just different. Maybe it meant that the people who were here had to matter more to each other.

---

At the edge of the Okonkwo camp, they said goodnight.

"See you tomorrow," Emeka said. "We'll find the best building site in the whole valley. And then we'll start on that path."

"See you tomorrow."

Oliver walked home alone, climbing the ridge in the starlight. When he reached the house, he turned and looked back. He could see Emeka's figure in the distance, climbing into the crawler, a shadow against the glow of lights.

A month ago, he didn't know anyone in the eastern valleys. Now he had a neighbor. Maybe even a friend.

He went inside, where Mama and Papa were talking quietly by lamplight.

"Did you have a good time?" Mama asked.

"Yeah," Oliver said. "I did."

He went to his room and opened his notebook. At the bottom of the day's entries, he added one more line:

*The Okonkwos arrived today. Emeka talks a lot. I think we might be friends.*

He closed the notebook and looked out the window at the two moons hanging in the sky. Tomorrow there would be work to do—helping the Okonkwos get started, building that path Emeka had talked about, checking the garden, all the hundred tasks that never seemed to end.

But tonight, for the first time since they arrived, Oliver didn't feel like the only kid in the world.

That was worth something. That was worth a lot.
