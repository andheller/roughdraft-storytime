# When Things Go Wrong

The storm came without warning.

One moment, the sky was clear. The next, dark clouds were boiling over the western hills, moving faster than Oliver had ever seen clouds move. The wind picked up, turning warm and restless, making the grass flatten and the trees bend.

"Everyone inside," Papa said, his voice tight. "Now."

They barely made it to the house before the rain started.

It wasn't normal rain. It came down in sheets, so thick Oliver couldn't see the garden from the window. The wind howled around the corners of the house, finding every crack and gap. Thea pressed close to Mama, her eyes wide.

"It's just a storm," Mama said. But her voice was strained.

Papa was at the window, staring out at the gray blur. "The garden," he said quietly. "The tomatoes aren't staked well enough. The beans are just starting to climb."

Oliver understood. They had spent months building this garden, planting seeds, watching them grow. If the storm flattened everything, they would have to start over—but the planting season was almost over. There might not be enough time.

"Can we do anything?" Oliver asked.

Papa shook his head. "Not in this. We wait."

---

The storm lasted three hours.

The rain hammered the roof. The wind screamed. Once, something crashed outside—later they would find that the tool shed had lost part of its roof. But inside, all they could do was sit and listen and hope.

When the rain finally slowed to a drizzle, Papa grabbed his coat.

"I'm going to check the damage."

"I'll come," Oliver said.

Papa looked at him for a moment, then nodded.

---

The garden was a disaster.

The tomato plants, which had been waist-high that morning, were bent and broken. The bean stakes had collapsed, tangling the vines in the mud. The lettuce bed was flooded, the leaves battered and torn. Everywhere Oliver looked, he saw damage.

"We'll lose some of it," Papa said heavily. "Maybe a lot of it."

Oliver felt his stomach drop. All that work. All those weeks of watering and weeding and watching and waiting. Gone in three hours.

But Papa was already moving. "We can save some," he said. "If we work fast. Get the others."

---

The word spread through the valley like fire.

Within an hour, everyone who could work was in the Aldridge garden. Not just Papa and Oliver—Mr. Okonkwo and Samuel, the Lindgrens, the Vasquezes, even Mrs. Parkinson with her bad knee and her gardening gloves.

"Tell us what to do," Mr. Okonkwo said.

Papa organized them into teams. One group would restake the tomatoes, carefully lifting the broken plants and tying them to new supports. Another group would drain the flooded beds, digging channels to carry the water away. A third group would cover the most damaged plants with protective cloth, giving them a chance to recover.

Oliver was put on the drainage team.

It was hard work. The ground was thick mud, heavy and clinging. Every shovelful felt like it weighed a hundred kilograms. The drizzle kept falling, soaking through Oliver's coat, running down his face. His arms burned. His back ached.

But he kept digging.

---

Night fell, and they kept working.

Someone brought lanterns. Someone else brought hot soup and bread from Valley House, passing it around so people could eat without stopping. The children who were too young to help watched from the edges, holding umbrellas over the workers, bringing tools when asked.

Marchman worked without rest.

He moved through the garden like a machine—which, Oliver reminded himself, he was. His four arms never stopped. He lifted, dug, carried, held things steady, did whatever needed doing. Water streamed off his metal body. His joints creaked and groaned. But he didn't slow down.

Oliver found himself working beside him for a while, passing tools, holding things steady while Marchman secured them. The workerbot didn't speak—he rarely did—but once, when Oliver stumbled in the mud, one of those big metal hands caught his arm and steadied him.

"Thanks," Oliver said.

Marchman nodded once and kept working.

---

It was past midnight when they finally stopped.

Everyone was exhausted. Covered in mud, soaked through, hands blistered and raw. But looking at the garden, Oliver could see that they had saved more than he had expected.

The tomatoes were upright again, supported by new stakes and careful ties. The beans had been untangled and replanted where they could climb. The flooded beds had been drained, the damaged plants covered with protective cloth.

Some things were lost. A section of lettuce that had been crushed beyond saving. Half the squash plants, their stems snapped at the base. The herbs near the fence, which had been swept away when a small flood channel had overflowed.

But most of the garden had survived. Most of what they had worked for was still there.

---

Papa found Oliver sitting on an overturned bucket, staring at the garden.

The sky was clearing. One of the moons was visible through the thinning clouds, casting pale light over the muddy rows.

Papa sat down beside him. He didn't say anything for a long moment.

Then he put his hand on Oliver's shoulder.

"You did good work tonight," he said.

Oliver looked at his father. Papa's face was tired, lined, older than Oliver had ever seen it. But there was something else in his expression too. Pride, maybe. Respect.

"I just dug trenches," Oliver said.

"You worked as hard as anyone here. Harder than some of the adults. You didn't complain, didn't slow down, didn't ask to stop. You just kept going."

"I wanted to help."

"You did help. You're part of this now—not because you're a kid living with your family, but because you earned your place. Tonight, you worked like a grownup. That matters."

Oliver didn't know what to say. He felt something swelling in his chest, something bigger than he had words for. It wasn't just pride. It was... belonging. Being part of something. Knowing that he mattered.

"Thanks," he finally said.

Papa squeezed his shoulder. "Let's go get some sleep. Tomorrow there's more work to do."

The next day, the whole valley gathered to help.

Not just the Aldridges—every family's garden had taken damage. So they went from homestead to homestead, just like they had done when building houses, working together to repair what the storm had broken.

It was hard to see the losses. The Okonkwos had lost most of their corn. The Lindgrens' root vegetables were ruined, drowned in their beds. The Vasquezes had a flooded cellar that took three days to drain.

But the losses could have been so much worse.

"We built these houses strong," Mama said, looking around the valley at the homes that had all survived intact. "And we planted our gardens together, on good ground with good drainage. If we hadn't worked so hard—if we'd cut corners, taken shortcuts—this storm would have destroyed us."

---

That evening, the families gathered in Valley House.

Not to celebrate—there wasn't much to celebrate, with so much damage to repair. But to be together. To share food and warmth and the simple comfort of not being alone.

Mr. Tarrant came too. He had ridden through the storm to check on the new settlers, and now he sat in the corner, his weathered face thoughtful.

"First bad storm?" he asked Papa.

"First one like that."

"There'll be more. The weather here is unpredictable—always has been. But you handled it well. Better than most newcomers."

"We almost lost everything."

"Almost doesn't count. You had a plan, you worked together, you saved what could be saved." Mr. Tarrant looked around the room at all the tired, muddy, determined faces. "That's what matters. Not avoiding problems—nobody can avoid problems. What matters is what you do when problems come."

---

Later, Oliver wrote in his notebook.

*The storm came. We lost some plants. We saved more. Everyone helped.*

He thought for a moment, then added:

*Papa said I did good work. He said I earned my place.*

He closed the notebook and looked out the window at the recovering garden. Some of the plants were wilted, struggling to recover. Others were already standing straighter, reaching for the light.

It would take weeks to know how much they had really lost. Weeks of watching and waiting and hoping. But the garden was still there. The house was still there. The community was still there.

They had been tested, and they had survived.

That had to count for something.

Oliver turned off his lamp and went to sleep. Tomorrow, there would be more work. There was always more work.

But that was okay. Work was how you built things that lasted.

And he was ready.
