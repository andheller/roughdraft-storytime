# The Glass River

They reached the river on the eleventh day.

Oliver saw it first—a flash of silver through the trees ahead, catching the morning light. As they drew closer, the flash became a ribbon, and the ribbon became a river, wide and slow and impossibly clear.

"That's why they call it the Glass River," Papa said, stopping the crawler on a low rise above the bank. "You can see all the way to the bottom."

Oliver climbed out and walked to the edge. Papa was right. The water was so clear it almost wasn't there. He could see smooth stones on the riverbed, ten feet down. He could see small fish darting in the current, silver and quick. He could see the ripples in the sand where the water flowed over it.

"It's beautiful," Mama said quietly.

It was. But it was also wide. Very wide. And somewhere on the other side was their land.

"How do we get across?" Thea asked.

Papa studied the river, shading his eyes with his hand. "There should be a ford about two kilometers upstream. The maps show a place where the river spreads out and gets shallow. We can cross there."

"Should be?" Mama said.

"The maps are from the survey crews. They're a few years old. Rivers change." Papa looked at Penny. "Can you scout ahead? Find the best crossing?"

Penny nodded once. She walked down the bank, tested the edge of the water with one foot, then stepped in and waded forward. The water came up to her waist, then her chest, and then she was walking on the bottom, completely submerged, following the riverbed upstream.

"She'll be all right," Mama said, seeing Oliver's face. "Penny doesn't need to breathe like we do. The water won't hurt her."

Oliver knew that. But it was still strange to watch her disappear under the silver surface, leaving only bubbles behind.

They waited.

Papa walked along the bank, looking for any sign of other crossings. Mama unpacked a midday meal. Thea found a stick and poked at the water, trying to get the fish to come closer.

Oliver sat on a rock and watched the river.

It was peaceful here. The water made a soft rushing sound as it flowed past. Birds called from the trees on the far bank. The air smelled different than it had in the grasslands—wetter, greener, full of growing things.

This was the edge of their new life. On this side of the river, they were still travelers. On the other side, they would be home.

If they could get across.

An hour later, Penny emerged from the water upstream. She walked back to them, water streaming off her metal body, and reported what she had found.

"The ford is there," she said, pointing. "One point six kilometers. The water spreads wide and becomes shallow—less than one meter deep in most places. But the ground is soft. The crawler may have difficulty."

"May?" Papa asked.

"The soil is sandy. It has been raining upstream. There are tracks in the mud—another crawler crossed recently, perhaps a week ago. They made it through, but they left deep ruts."

Papa thought about this. "We'll have to try. Going around would add days, and we're low on supplies."

"I can help," Marchman said. It was the first time Oliver had heard him speak on the whole journey. His voice was deep and mechanical, like stones grinding together. "If the crawler gets stuck, I can pull."

Papa nodded. "Then we try."

---

The ford was exactly where Penny had said it would be.

The river spread out here, becoming wide and shallow, more like a lake than a stream. Oliver could see the bottom clearly—packed sand with patches of mud, and the deep ruts Penny had mentioned, filled with dark water.

Papa drove the crawler slowly down the bank and into the river.

At first, everything went well. The wheels found traction on the sandy bottom. Water rose to the wheel hubs, then higher, swirling around the crawler's undercarriage. Oliver and Thea watched from the back, looking down at the clear water flowing past.

"We're doing it," Thea said. "We're—"

The crawler lurched.

The front left wheel had found soft ground. It sank, tilting the whole vehicle to one side. Papa pressed the accelerator, and the wheels spun, throwing up clouds of muddy water.

"Hold on," Papa said. His voice was calm but tight.

He tried again. The wheels spun. The crawler sank deeper.

"We're stuck," Mama said.

Papa climbed out of the driver's seat and dropped into the water. It came up to his waist. He waded to the front of the crawler and knelt down, feeling around the sunken wheel with his hands.

"The sand is like soup," he reported. "The harder we push, the deeper we go."

Oliver felt his stomach drop. They were stuck in the middle of a river, with all their supplies, with everything they owned. If they couldn't get out—

"Marchman," Papa called.

Marchman was already moving. He waded past Papa to the front of the crawler, his heavy body making waves in the shallow water. He bent down and gripped the front axle with his four arms.

"When I lift," he said, "drive forward."

Papa climbed back into the driver's seat. Mama came to stand beside Oliver and Thea, her hands on their shoulders.

"Ready?" Marchman asked.

"Ready."

Marchman pulled.

Oliver had never seen anything like it. Marchman's arms strained, his joints creaking with the effort. Slowly, impossibly, the front of the crawler began to rise. The sunken wheel came free of the mud with a wet sucking sound.

"Now!" Marchman shouted.

Papa hit the accelerator. The wheels caught. The crawler lurched forward. For a terrible moment Oliver thought they would sink again, but then the wheels found solid ground and they were moving, really moving, climbing out of the soft patch and up the far bank.

They had made it.

---

Papa stopped the crawler on solid ground and everyone climbed out.

Marchman stood in the shallows, water streaming from his body. Oliver thought he looked tired, which was strange because robots didn't get tired. But something in the way he stood, the way his arms hung at his sides, suggested that the effort had cost him something.

"Thank you," Papa said to him.

Marchman nodded once. "The crawler is heavy. But not too heavy."

Penny went to him and began checking his joints, looking for damage. Oliver heard them talking quietly—Penny's soft voice, Marchman's rumbling one—and he understood that in their own way, they were family too.

---

They made camp on the far bank that night, even though the sun was still high.

"We all need rest," Papa said. "Tomorrow we'll reach our land. Tonight, we recover."

Oliver helped set up camp, going through the familiar motions without thinking. Perimeter alarm. Solar shade. Water canisters. Each task felt different now, on this side of the river. More real somehow.

After supper, he walked to the top of a small hill behind the camp. He wanted to see what was ahead.

The land rose gently before him, rolling hills covered in grass and scattered trees. In the distance, he could see higher hills, green and forested. And somewhere beyond those hills, hidden from view, was the piece of ground that would become their home.

They were so close now. One more day, maybe two.

He thought about the journey—the city falling away behind them, the nights under the stars, the stones he had collected at each campsite. He thought about Marchman lifting the crawler out of the river, Penny scouting the ford, Mama staying calm when things went wrong.

They had done this together. All of them.

He went back to camp and found his notebook.

*Day 11. Crossed the Glass River. Marchman saved us. Tomorrow we see our land.*

The next morning, they started early.

The road—if you could call it a road, more like wheel-tracks through the grass—wound up into the green hills. The crawler climbed steadily, the engine humming with the effort.

Oliver sat in the front with Papa, watching the landscape unfold. Everything was greener here, more alive. He saw birds he didn't recognize, and once, in the distance, something large and four-legged that disappeared into the trees before he could get a good look.

"Almost there," Papa said.

They crested a final hill, and Papa stopped the crawler.

Below them spread a valley, wide and flat and brown. The Glass River curved along one edge, silver in the morning light. Green hills rose on the far side. And in the middle of the valley, barely visible in the grass, were the small white stakes that marked the boundaries of their land.

Forty hectares. Four thousand meters on a side.

More land than Oliver could walk across in an hour. More land than he had ever seen that belonged to anyone, let alone to his family.

"There it is," Papa said quietly. "That's ours."

Oliver stared. He tried to take it all in—the size of it, the realness of it, the fact that they had actually made it here. After three years of waiting, after six hundred kilometers of traveling, after everything—

This was their home.

Thea squeezed between them to look. "It's so big," she whispered.

"Yes," Mama said, coming to stand behind them. "It is."

For a long moment, no one said anything else. They just looked.

Then Papa started the crawler again, and they drove down into the valley, toward the stakes and the brown earth and the beginning of everything new.
