# The Network

The Lindgrens arrived at the end of summer.

They came in a crawler even older than the Aldridges', piled high with belongings and trailing a cloud of dust. There were six of them—Mr. and Mrs. Lindgren, their teenage son Erik, and the twins, Liv and Astrid, who were seven years old and impossible to tell apart.

"Which one are you?" Thea asked the twin standing closest to her.

"I'm Liv," the girl said. Then she grinned. "Or maybe I'm Astrid. Sometimes we switch."

The other twin giggled. Thea's eyes went wide with delight.

"Uh oh," Oliver muttered to Emeka.

"Double uh oh," Emeka agreed.

Within an hour, the three girls had disappeared into the tall grass along the river, their laughter floating back on the wind. By dinner, they had already hatched three schemes, broken one rule, and started what Thea called a "secret club" with a password nobody else was allowed to know.

"They're going to be trouble," Oliver told Mama.

Mama smiled. "Good trouble, I think. Thea needs friends her own age."

The Lindgrens weren't the only new family.

In the weeks that followed, others arrived—the Vasquezes from a mining settlement to the west, the Henrys from a city in the northern hemisphere, the Parkinsons with their grandmother and their baby and their three dogs. One by one, crawlers rolled down into the valley, found their stakes, and began the hard work of building.

The valley that had been empty was becoming full.

Not full like the city—there were still wide open spaces between the homesteads, still room to walk for an hour without seeing another person. But the empty feeling was gone. At night, Oliver could see lights in the distance—the Okonkwos to the west, the Lindgrens to the northwest, the Vasquezes across the river. Each light meant a family, a kitchen, someone else making a home.

They weren't alone anymore.

The work days started because there was too much to do.

Every family needed a house built before the rainy season. Every family needed a garden planted, a well dug, a water system set up. One family working alone could barely keep up. But if everyone worked together—

"We'll rotate," Papa suggested at a gathering of all the families. "One day, everyone helps the Lindgrens. Next day, everyone helps the Vasquezes. We share tools, share knowledge, share labor. By the time the rains come, everyone will have a roof."

The other adults agreed. Mr. Okonkwo drew up a schedule. Mrs. Parkinson organized the tool sharing. And the next morning, every able body in the valley showed up at the Lindgren site to help raise walls.

Oliver worked alongside Emeka and Samuel and Erik Lindgren and half a dozen other kids, hauling panels, holding things steady, passing tools to the adults who knew how to use them. It was hard work, harder than anything he'd done on his own family's house because the sun was hotter now and there were more people to coordinate.

But it was also... fun?

He didn't know exactly how to describe it. There was something about working together, about seeing a wall go up that you had helped raise, about knowing that you were part of something bigger than yourself. At the end of the day, when the Lindgren house had four walls and everyone sat down to share a meal, Oliver felt like he belonged to something.

Not just his family. Not just his land.

Something bigger.

On the rest days, Oliver and Emeka explored.

They followed the Glass River upstream, past the ford where the Aldridges had crossed, into the hills where the water ran faster over rocks and fallen logs. They found a swimming hole, deep and cold, where the river widened into a natural pool. They found caves in the hillside, small and dark, that Emeka was convinced held treasure.

"There's nothing in here," Oliver said, shining his light into another empty hole.

"Not yet," Emeka said. "But maybe there will be. Maybe we should hide something, and then in a hundred years, someone will find it and wonder who we were."

"What would we hide?"

Emeka thought about it. "Something that tells our story. Like... a letter. Or a map. Or one of your drawings."

Oliver looked at the empty cave. It wasn't a bad idea, actually. Leaving something behind for people who came after. Proof that they had been here.

"Maybe when we're older," he said. "When we have something worth leaving."

"Deal," Emeka said. He spat on his palm and held out his hand. "When we're older, we come back here and bury our treasure."

Oliver spat on his own palm and shook. It was a silly ritual, the kind of thing little kids did. But out here, with no one watching, it felt right.

Meanwhile, Thea and the twins were getting into everything.

They built a fort in the grass between the Aldridge and Lindgren properties—a tangled mess of sticks and stolen canvas that collapsed every time the wind blew. They tried to catch fish in the river using nets made from Mama's old stockings. They climbed trees they shouldn't climb, explored gullies they shouldn't explore, and once came home covered in mud from head to toe with no explanation for how it had happened.

"We were investigating," Liv said solemnly.

"It was scientific," Astrid added.

"We found important things," Thea concluded.

No one could get them to say what the important things were. Oliver suspected they had just fallen in a puddle and made up the rest.

But he understood, in a way. They were learning the land too, just in their own way. Running and climbing and getting dirty was how kids their age figured things out. By the time they were Oliver's age, they would know every hiding spot in the valley.

The idea for the common house came from Mrs. Henry.

"We need a place to gather," she said at one of the evening meetings that had become a regular thing. "Somewhere big enough for all of us. For meetings, for celebrations, for bad weather when we can't be outside."

"We barely have enough materials for our own houses," Mr. Vasquez pointed out.

"We pool what we have left over. Everyone contributes what they can. It doesn't have to be fancy—just four walls and a roof and enough room for all the families to fit inside."

The adults talked it over. There were practical concerns—where to build, how to share the work, who would maintain it once it was finished. But underneath the practical talk, Oliver could feel the excitement.

This wasn't just about having a building. It was about being something more than separate families living near each other. It was about being a community.

---

They built the common house on a rise at the center of the valley.

It was bigger than any of the family homes—twice as wide, with high ceilings and windows on all sides. The families worked on it together, fitting the work around their own tasks, contributing whatever time and materials they could spare.

Oliver helped with the interior walls. He was good at the detail work now—fitting panels precisely, making sure seals were tight, checking measurements twice before cutting anything. Emeka teased him about being slow, but Oliver noticed that Emeka's sections always had to be redone while Oliver's passed inspection the first time.

"Careful is faster than fixing mistakes," Oliver told him.

"You sound like my father," Emeka groaned.

"Your father is smart."

The common house was finished on a day in late summer.

All the families gathered to see it—fourteen adults, eleven children, three workerbots, and assorted utility robots including Penny. They stood in a loose circle around the building, looking at what they had made together.

"It's beautiful," Mama said quietly.

It wasn't beautiful, not really. It was plain and practical, built for function rather than appearance. But there was something beautiful about what it represented. All these people, strangers a few months ago, coming together to build something none of them could have built alone.

Papa stepped forward. "I think we should name it," he said. "Every important place needs a name."

"The Meeting Hall," someone suggested.

"The Gathering Place."

"The Big House."

"What about Valley House?" Oliver said. Everyone looked at him. He felt his face get hot. "Because... it's in the valley. And it belongs to everyone in the valley."

There was a moment of silence. Then Mr. Okonkwo nodded slowly.

"Valley House," he said. "I like it."

Others murmured agreement. And just like that, the building had a name.

That night, they held the first gathering in Valley House.

Someone had strung lights from the ceiling. Someone else had carried in tables and chairs. The room was full of people and noise and warmth—Emeka arguing with his brother, the twins chasing each other around the tables, adults laughing and talking and passing food.

Oliver stood by the door for a moment, watching.

A few months ago, his family had been the only people in the eastern valleys. They had arrived at empty land, with nothing but stakes in the ground and the hope that they could build a life here.

Now look at them.

Houses dotted the valley. Gardens grew behind every home. Children ran through the grass, and lights glowed in windows, and people gathered in a building they had made together.

This wasn't just their land anymore. It was becoming something bigger.

It was becoming a town.

Oliver smiled and went to join his family. Emeka waved him over to a corner where the kids were planning some kind of expedition for tomorrow. Thea ran past with the twins close behind, all three of them laughing.

Outside, the two moons rose over the eastern valleys, shining down on all of it—the houses and the gardens and the Valley House and the people inside.

Home, Oliver thought.

Not just their home.

Everyone's home.
