# Forty Hectares

Spring came slowly to the eastern valleys.

First the days grew longer, the sun climbing higher each morning. Then the snow that had dusted the hills began to melt, trickling down into streams that fed the Glass River. The grass turned from brown to pale green, and small flowers appeared in the meadows—purple and yellow and white, pushing up through the cold soil toward the light.

Oliver stood at the window of his room—his real room now, with a proper bed and a desk Papa had built and shelves for his books and notebooks—and watched the valley wake up.

One year. It had been one year since the letter came.

The garden was ready for planting.

Oliver and Mama had spent the winter planning—which crops to grow, where to plant them, how to rotate the beds so the soil stayed healthy. They had seeds saved from last year's harvest, plus new varieties they had traded for at the winter market.

"This year we'll try wheat," Mama said, showing him the small bag of seeds. "Just a test plot. If it grows well, we can expand next year."

"And fruit trees," Papa added. He had brought back three tiny saplings from a nursery Mr. Tarrant knew about—apple, pear, and something called a starfruit that only grew on this planet. "They won't bear fruit for a few years. But by the time you're grown, they'll be as tall as the house."

Oliver tried to imagine it—trees as tall as the house, heavy with fruit. It was hard to picture. But then, a year ago, it had been hard to picture any of this.

The new families arrived in early spring.

Oliver heard the first crawler coming from miles away—the distant hum of an engine, the crunch of wheels on the road that the settlers had built last autumn, connecting all the homesteads to each other and to the river crossing.

"Someone's coming," he called.

Everyone came out to watch. The crawler rolled down into the valley, dusty and dented from a long journey. A man and woman sat in front, and Oliver could see children peering through the canvas at the back.

"They look scared," Emeka said, coming to stand beside him.

"We probably looked the same way when we got here."

"I wasn't scared," Emeka said. Then, more quietly, "Okay, maybe a little scared."

The crawler stopped, and the family climbed out. The man looked around at the houses, the gardens being prepared for planting, the people gathered to greet them. His face had the same expression Oliver remembered from his own arrival—overwhelmed, uncertain, wondering if this had been a mistake.

Papa walked forward to shake the man's hand.

"Welcome to the eastern valleys," Papa said. "I'm Henry Aldridge. We've been expecting you."

---

The newcomers' name was Chen—Mr. and Mrs. Chen, with three children: a boy about Oliver's age, a younger girl, and a baby in Mrs. Chen's arms.

Oliver was assigned to show the boy around.

His name was David. He was quiet, even quieter than Oliver, and he spent the first hour looking at everything without saying much. Oliver remembered that feeling too—trying to take in so much newness that words felt pointless.

"This is the river," Oliver said, leading David down the path he and Emeka had worn over dozens of trips. "It's called the Glass River because you can see all the way to the bottom. The ford is about two kilometers upstream—that's probably where you crossed."

David nodded.

"There's a swimming hole up that way, in the hills. When summer comes, all the kids go there. And caves—Emeka and I found caves. They're empty, but we're going to bury treasure in one someday."

"Treasure?"

"Something to leave behind. So people in the future know we were here."

David thought about this. "That's a good idea."

They walked along the river in silence for a while. Finally, David spoke again.

"Is it hard? Living here?"

Oliver considered the question.

"Yes," he said honestly. "It's hard work. Every day, there's something that needs doing. Building, planting, fixing, carrying. You get tired. Your hands hurt. Sometimes things go wrong and you have to start over."

David's face fell.

"But," Oliver continued, "it's also... I don't know how to explain it. In the city, I never felt like I was part of anything. I just went to school and came home and did whatever I was told. Out here, everything I do matters. When I plant a seed, it grows into food. When I build something, it stays built. When I help someone, they help me back." He paused. "It's hard, but it's worth it. Does that make sense?"

David looked out at the valley—the houses on the ridges, the gardens being prepared, the people moving around doing the work of spring.

"I think so," he said. "I hope so."

That evening, the families gathered at Valley House to welcome the Chens.

It was just like the feast after the harvest, except now there were more people, more food, more noise. The twins had taught the Chen girl some kind of clapping game, and the sound of their laughter echoed off the rafters. The adults talked about crops and weather and all the plans for the coming year.

Oliver sat with Emeka and David, teaching David the names of everyone in the settlement.

"That's Mr. Tarrant—he's not really from here, but he comes by a lot. He knows everything about farming. And that's Samuel—Emeka's brother—he's going to apprentice with the repair crew at the market town next year. And those are the twins, Liv and Astrid, but don't bother trying to tell them apart because they switch on purpose..."

David listened, eyes wide, trying to absorb it all.

"You'll learn," Emeka assured him. "It took me a while too. But eventually, everyone just feels like family."

Later, after the gathering broke up and the families headed home, Oliver walked to the edge of the property.

He did this sometimes, when he needed to think. The western boundary, where the land rose toward the hills, had the best view of the whole valley. From here, you could see everything—the river, the houses, the gardens, Valley House in the center, the road winding away toward the ford.

He sat on a rock and reached into his pocket.

The stone was still there. The first one he had collected, on that first night of the journey, when they had camped beside a stream and he had seen more stars than he had ever imagined existed.

He turned it over in his fingers. Smooth gray, worn by water, warmed by his hand. Such a small thing. But it held everything—the whole journey, the whole year, everything that had happened since that night.

He thought about the boy he had been then. Nine years old, scared, unable to imagine what forty hectares even looked like.

Now he was ten. Still young, still learning. But different. Stronger. More capable. Someone who had built a house and planted a garden and weathered a storm and helped new settlers find their way.

He looked out at the valley—at the lights coming on in windows, at the moons rising over the eastern hills, at the land that had become so familiar he could walk it in his sleep.

Forty hectares.

A year ago, it had seemed impossibly big. Too much to understand, too much to imagine.

Now it felt exactly right.

Every field had a name. Every neighbor was a friend. Every path was one he had walked before. The land wasn't a stranger anymore—it was home.

Papa found him there, sitting on the rock with the stone in his hand.

"Room for one more?" Papa asked.

Oliver scooted over. Papa sat down beside him, looking out at the same view.

"Thinking about something?" Papa asked.

"Just... everything. The year. How much has changed."

Papa nodded slowly. "It has changed, hasn't it? Feels like we just got here. But also feels like we've been here forever."

"Next year will be even bigger," Oliver said. "More families coming. More houses. Mr. Tarrant says they might build a school."

"A school would be good. Thea's getting too wild running around with those twins. She needs something to focus on."

They sat in comfortable silence for a while. The moons rose higher. The lights in the valley windows glowed warm and steady.

"Papa?" Oliver said.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For bringing us here. For... everything."

Papa put his arm around Oliver's shoulders.

"Thank you," Papa said. "For being part of it. For working hard. For becoming who you're becoming." He paused. "I'm proud of you, Oliver. Really proud."

Oliver didn't say anything. He didn't need to. He just leaned into his father's arm and watched the moons rise over their valley, their home, their forty hectares.

Somewhere in the distance, an animal called—one of the native creatures, the ones with four eyes that the twins were still trying to find. The wind stirred the grass. The stars came out, thousands of them, just like that first night on the road.

A year ago, everything had been new and frightening and impossible.

Now it was just... home.

And that, Oliver thought, was exactly how it was supposed to be.
