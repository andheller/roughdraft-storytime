# The Long Road

The first day, they passed through the outer districts of the city.

Oliver watched through the canvas window as familiar things gave way to unfamiliar ones. First the tall apartment buildings, crowded together like people waiting for a train. Then the lower industrial buildings, with their chimneys and loading docks. Then the agricultural domes, great curved structures where food was grown under artificial light.

And then, around midday, the city ended.

Oliver had never seen the edge before. He had known it existed—the city had to end somewhere—but he had never actually watched it happen. One moment there were buildings and roads and people. The next moment there was just... land.

Open land, stretching in every direction, covered with low scrubby plants he didn't recognize. The sky seemed bigger out here. The horizon seemed farther away.

"This is the settled zone," Papa called back to them. "Terraformed about fifty years ago. Some families farm here, but most of the land is still wild."

Thea pressed her face against the window. "Where are the animals?"

"They're out there," Papa said. "They just know how to hide. Maybe you'll see some tonight, when it's quiet."

That first evening, Papa stopped the crawler beside a small stream.

"This is where we'll camp," he said. "Everyone out. There's work to do."

Oliver had never set up a camp before. In the city, everything was already there—walls, floors, beds, kitchens. You didn't have to make anything. You just used what was built.

Out here, everything had to be done.

Papa showed him how to unfold the solar shade from the top of the crawler, stretching it out to cover a space where they could sit and cook. Mama started a small cookfire using dried fuel bricks from their supplies. Marchman unloaded the water canisters and carried them to the stream to fill.

"Can I help?" Oliver asked Penny.

Penny tilted her head—that way she had of looking at you when she was thinking. Then she handed him a bundle of stakes and rope.

"The perimeter alarm," she said. Her voice was soft and slightly mechanical, but warm somehow. "We set it around our camp each night. It will beep if anything large crosses it."

Oliver followed her instructions carefully. He walked in a wide circle around the crawler, pushing stakes into the ground at regular intervals, running the thin alarm wire between them. It wasn't hard work, but it was real work. It mattered.

When he finished, Penny checked his work and adjusted two of the stakes.

"Good," she said. "Tomorrow, you'll remember which ones to move."

They ate supper as the sun went down.

Mama had made a simple meal—rehydrated stew with bread from their supplies. It wasn't fancy, but Oliver was hungry, and the food tasted better than he expected. Maybe food always tasted better when you'd worked for it.

After supper, Papa took out his concertina.

It was an old instrument, smaller than a guitar, with buttons instead of keys and bellows that wheezed when you squeezed them. Papa had owned it since he was young. He said it was the one thing he had brought from his parents' house when he left to start his own life.

Papa played a slow song that Oliver didn't recognize—something about rivers and traveling and coming home. The music floated out over the empty land, the only sound except for insects chirping in the grass.

When the song ended, Thea was asleep against Mama's shoulder. Mama carried her into the crawler and put her to bed.

Oliver stayed outside with Papa.

"Look up," Papa said quietly.

Oliver looked.

The sky was full of stars.

Not a few stars, not the scattered handful he had seen from the city where the lights drowned out most of the sky. Hundreds of stars. Thousands of them. More stars than Oliver had ever imagined could exist.

A thick band of light stretched across the middle of the sky—the galaxy itself, Papa said, seen from the inside. And there, rising over the eastern hills, were the two moons. One pale blue, one amber, hanging in the darkness like lanterns.

"I never knew," Oliver whispered.

"Neither did I, the first time I saw it," Papa said. "I was about your age. My father brought me out past the city one night, just to see the stars. I never forgot it."

Oliver stared until his neck hurt. He tried to count the stars, but there were too many. He tried to find patterns in them, shapes and lines, but the patterns kept shifting the longer he looked.

Finally, Papa said it was time for bed.

Oliver climbed into the crawler and found his bunk. But before he slept, he reached into his box of belongings and pulled out his notebook. By the dim light from the window, he wrote:

*Day 1. Left the city. Camped by a stream. More stars than I could count.*

Then he added one more line:

*Tomorrow I will find a stone to remember this place.*

The days that followed blurred together.

Each morning, Oliver woke before dawn to help break camp. He learned to take down the perimeter alarm, coil the rope properly, pack the stakes so they wouldn't rattle. He learned to check the crawler's water reserves and battery levels. He learned which boxes held food and which held tools and where everything belonged.

Each day, the crawler rolled forward across the land. The terrain changed slowly—scrubby plains giving way to grassland, grassland giving way to gentle hills covered with purple-gray plants Oliver had never seen in any book.

"Native species," Mama explained. "The terraforming helped some Earth plants grow, but the planet's own life is starting to come back too. Scientists think it was here millions of years ago, before the climate changed. Now the soil is right for it again."

Thea had a thousand questions. Why was the sky that color? What were those plants called? Why did Marchman's joints squeak sometimes? How far was it to the eastern valleys? Were there really animals out here? What did they eat? Why didn't they live in the city too?

Mama and Papa answered as many questions as they could. When they didn't know the answer, they said so.

"We're all learning," Papa told her. "That's part of why we're going. To learn what this land can teach us."

---

Each evening, they stopped to camp.

Oliver kept his promise to himself. At every campsite, he found a stone—something interesting, something different from the stones at the last place. A smooth gray pebble from the first stream. A red-speckled rock from the grasslands. A flat blue stone from a dry creek bed in the hills.

He kept them in a small pouch, arranged in order. When he looked at them, he could remember each place, each night, each step of the journey.

"You're building a collection," Penny observed one evening, watching him sort through his stones.

"I want to remember," Oliver said. "I want to know where we've been."

Penny's sensor plates lifted slightly—her version of a smile. "That's a good instinct. The past helps us understand the present."

On the eighth night, they camped on a high ridge overlooking a vast valley.

The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. Below them, the valley stretched for miles, covered in tall golden grass that rippled in the wind like water.

"Look," Papa said, pointing toward the far edge of the valley. "See that silver line? That's the Glass River. And beyond it—those green hills—that's the eastern valleys."

Oliver's heart jumped. "That's where we're going?"

"That's where we're going. A few more days, and we'll be there."

Oliver stared at the distant hills. They looked far away still, but closer than anything had looked before. Real. Possible.

Somewhere in those hills, forty hectares were waiting.

He reached down and picked up a stone from the ridge—pale white, shaped like a teardrop. He would add it to his collection tonight. The last stone of the journey, before everything changed.

---

That night, lying in his bunk, Oliver listened to the wind outside the crawler.

It was a different sound than the wind in the city, which had always been broken up by buildings and machines. Out here, the wind moved freely. It came from somewhere far away and was going somewhere far away, and they were just passing through.

He thought about the city, about his old apartment, about the room he had shared with Thea and the hallway he had measured with his feet. All of that felt distant now, like something from a long time ago.

This journey was changing him. He could feel it. Each day of work, each stone he collected, each night under the stars—they were all making him into someone different. Someone who knew how to set up camp and read the landscape and understand that the world was bigger than he had ever imagined.

He wasn't sure yet who that person would be.

But he was ready to find out.
