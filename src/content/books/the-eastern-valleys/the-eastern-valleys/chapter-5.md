# The House Rises

Digging the foundation took three days.

The ground on the ridge was harder than Papa expected. Rocks lay just beneath the surface, some of them as big as Oliver's head. Marchman dug with a heavy shovel, his four arms working in steady rhythm, while Papa and Oliver hauled the dirt away in buckets.

It was hard work. Harder than anything Oliver had ever done. By the end of each day, his shoulders burned and his hands were blistered. He fell asleep the moment he lay down and woke feeling like he had never rested at all.

But every morning, when he climbed out of the crawler and looked at the rectangular trench carved into the ridge, he felt something that was stronger than tiredness. Pride, maybe. Or satisfaction. The feeling of watching something grow from nothing.

On the third day, they finished.

Papa stood at the edge of the trench, looking down at the flat packed earth at the bottom. The foundation was thirty centimeters deep, perfectly level, with drainage channels cut at each corner to carry water away from the house.

"Not bad," Papa said. "Not bad at all."

The wall panels came out of the crawler in flat stacks.

They were made of a special material—printed in factories in the city, designed to lock together like puzzle pieces. Each panel was light enough for two people to carry, but strong enough to stop wind and rain and keep heat inside.

"The settlers a hundred years ago had to cut trees and build from wood," Papa said, laying out the panels in order. "We're lucky. These panels will last longer than wood, and they go up faster."

Mama read the instructions while Papa and Marchman assembled. Oliver's job was to hold panels steady while Papa secured the connectors. Thea's job was to hand tools to whoever needed them and stay out of the way.

The first wall went up before noon.

Oliver stood back and looked at it. It was strange—just one wall, standing alone on the ridge, held up by temporary braces. It didn't look like much. But it was the beginning.

"Three more to go," Papa said. "Let's keep moving."

---

The walls grew faster than Oliver expected.

Once they understood the system—how the panels locked together, which connectors went where, what order to do things in—they fell into a rhythm. Papa directed. Marchman lifted. Mama and Penny fitted the smaller pieces. Oliver held things steady and watched and learned.

By the end of the second day of wall-building, all four walls were up.

They weren't finished yet—there were no windows, no doors, no roof—but the shape of the house was there. Oliver could walk inside and stand in what would become the kitchen, the main room, the bedrooms. He could see where the windows would go, where the door would open.

"It's starting to look like something," Mama said that evening.

Papa put his arm around her. "It's starting to look like home."

---

The windows came next.

They were made of a clear material that was stronger than glass, built to withstand storms and temperature changes. Papa showed Oliver how to fit them into the frames—carefully, slowly, making sure the seals were tight.

"A window that leaks lets heat out in winter and dust in during storms," Papa explained. "Take your time. Do it right."

Oliver worked on the window in what would be his and Thea's room. He thought about all the mornings he would look out this window, all the nights he would see the stars through it. He made sure the seals were perfect.

The door was simpler—a solid panel that swung on hinges, with a latch that locked from inside. Papa hung it himself, adjusting the hinges until it opened and closed smoothly.

"Try it," he told Oliver.

Oliver pushed the door open. He stepped through. He was inside the house. Then he stepped back out. He was outside.

Such a simple thing. But it meant something, having a door. Having an inside and an outside. Having a place that was theirs and a way to close it off from the rest of the world.

---

The roof was the hardest part.

The panels had to be lifted high and held in place while the connectors were secured. Even Marchman couldn't do it alone. Everyone worked together—Marchman holding the heavy end, Papa and Mama guiding the lighter end, Oliver standing on a ladder to secure the connectors, Penny calling out adjustments.

It was slow work. The sun beat down on them. Oliver's arms shook from holding his position on the ladder. Twice they had to stop and start over because a panel wasn't aligned right.

But finally, finally, the last panel clicked into place.

They had a roof.

Oliver climbed down from the ladder and stood back to look. The house stood on the ridge, solid and complete—walls, windows, door, roof. It was real. It was there.

"We did it," Thea said. "We really did it."

"Not quite done yet," Papa said. "We need solar panels for power and a water recycler. But yes. The hard part is finished."

---

The solar panels went on the roof, angled to catch the sun.

Penny climbed up and positioned them while Oliver handed panels up one at a time. She connected them to a battery pack inside the house, and suddenly there was power—lights that came on when you touched a switch, outlets where you could charge tools, a small heating unit for cold nights.

The water recycler was more complicated. Papa had to connect it to the house's plumbing, then run pipes to the cistern they would build outside. For now, they rigged a temporary system—water from the river, filtered and purified, stored in containers inside.

"Eventually we'll dig a well," Papa said. "And build a proper cistern to catch rainwater. But this will work for now."

It was evening when they finished.

Mama made supper in the house's kitchen—the first meal ever cooked there. It was simple food, the same supplies they had been eating for weeks. But it tasted different somehow. Better.

After supper, Papa got out his concertina and played.

Oliver sat on the floor—they didn't have furniture yet, that would come later—and listened. Through the window, he could see the sun setting over the valley, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple. The music filled the small house, warm and hopeful.

This was what they had worked for. This was what the journey and the digging and the building had been about. Not just walls and a roof, but a place where a family could be together. A place where music could fill the air and light could shine through windows and a door could close against the night.

---

That night, they slept in the house for the first time.

Their beds were just blankets on the floor, but it didn't matter. The floor was solid beneath them. The roof was solid above them. The walls kept out the wind and the dark and everything else.

Oliver lay awake for a long time, listening.

The house made sounds he hadn't expected—small creaks and settles as the panels adjusted to the night air. The wind whispered around the corners. Somewhere outside, an animal called once and fell silent.

But inside, everything was still. Inside was warm and dry and safe.

He thought about the city apartment, so far away now. He thought about the journey, the river crossing, the stakes he had driven into the ground. He thought about holding panels steady while Papa secured them, about climbing the ladder to connect roof pieces, about every task he had done to help build this house.

His hands still hurt. His shoulders still ached. But lying here, in this room, in this house, on this land—it was all worth it.

He had helped build this.

He turned over and closed his eyes. Tomorrow there would be more work—furniture to build, a garden to plant, a hundred other tasks they hadn't even thought of yet. But tonight, for the first time since they left the city, Oliver felt like he was exactly where he was supposed to be.

He fell asleep smiling.
