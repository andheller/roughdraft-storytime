# First Planting

"Before we plant anything," Mama said, "we need to understand the soil."

Oliver followed her to the plot they had marked out behind the house. It was a large rectangle—twenty meters by thirty meters—cleared of grass and waiting to become a garden. Papa and Marchman had spent two days removing rocks and breaking up the hard-packed earth. Now the ground was soft and brown and ready.

But ready for what?

"Soil isn't just dirt," Mama explained, kneeling at the edge of the plot. "It's alive. Billions of tiny organisms live in every handful, breaking down dead plants and turning them into nutrients. When the soil is healthy, plants grow strong. When it's sick, nothing grows well."

She scooped up a handful of earth and let it fall through her fingers.

"This soil has been treated by the terraforming crews. They added bacteria and fungi to help plants grow. But every piece of land is different. We need to test it, understand it, learn what it needs."

Penny brought out the soil testing kit.

It was a small device about the size of Oliver's hand, with a sharp probe that went into the ground and a screen that showed numbers. Mama showed Oliver how to use it—push the probe in, wait for the beep, read the results.

"What do the numbers mean?" Oliver asked.

"This one is pH—how acidic or alkaline the soil is. Most vegetables like it between six and seven. This soil is six point four. Good."

She pointed to another number.

"This is nitrogen. Plants need nitrogen to grow leaves. This number should be higher. We'll need to add compost or fertilizer."

"Where do we get compost?"

"We make it. All the plant waste—food scraps, dead leaves, anything organic—goes into a pile. Over time, it breaks down into rich soil that we can add to the garden."

Oliver wrote the numbers in his notebook. pH 6.4. Nitrogen: low. He wasn't sure what all of it meant yet, but he wanted to remember.

---

They tested the soil in different parts of the plot.

Some areas were better than others. The south side had more nutrients; the north side was sandier and drained faster. Near the edge where the grass used to grow, the soil was darker and richer.

"This tells us where to plant different things," Mama said. "Tomatoes like rich soil. Carrots prefer sandy soil because it's easier for their roots to push through. Beans actually add nitrogen to the soil, so we can plant them in the low-nitrogen areas."

Oliver had never thought about gardening this way. In the city, if you wanted vegetables, you went to the market. The food appeared on shelves, clean and packaged, and you didn't have to think about where it came from.

Out here, every vegetable came from the ground, grown by your own hands. And that meant understanding what the ground needed.

---

Penny showed Oliver how to read the soil sensors.

They were small stakes that stayed in the ground, monitoring conditions constantly and sending data to a tablet. Temperature. Moisture. Nutrient levels. Everything the plants needed, measured every hour.

"Watch the patterns," Penny said, showing him a graph on the tablet. "See how the moisture drops during the day and rises at night? That's because water evaporates when the sun is out. The plants need consistent moisture, so we water in the morning and evening when evaporation is lowest."

"How do you know all this?"

Penny's head tilted slightly. "I was built to help families manage their homes and land. Your grandmother programmed me with gardening knowledge fifty years ago. Some things I learned from her. Some things I learned from watching. Some things I learned from mistakes."

"You make mistakes?"

"Every gardener does. The important thing is to learn from them." She handed him the tablet. "This is yours now. Check it every morning and evening. Write down anything unusual. By the end of the season, you'll understand this garden better than anyone."

Oliver looked at the tablet, at the lines and numbers and graphs. It was like a language he didn't speak yet. But he wanted to learn.

---

The first planting day was chaotic.

Papa had laid out the beds according to Mama's plan—rows of mounded soil, with paths between them for walking and kneeling. But actually putting seeds in the ground was harder than it looked.

"Not too deep," Mama told Oliver, watching him push bean seeds into the soil. "Twice the depth of the seed, no more. If they're too deep, they won't have enough energy to reach the surface."

"Like this?" Oliver showed her.

"Perfect. Now cover them gently and pat the soil down. Not too hard—they need air around them."

Nearby, Thea was "helping" with the carrot seeds. Carrot seeds were tiny, almost like dust, and Thea kept spilling them.

"Oops," she said, for the fifth time.

Mama laughed. "That's all right. Carrots need to be thinned anyway. A few extra won't hurt."

"What's thinning?"

"When the seedlings come up, they'll be too close together. We pull out the weak ones so the strong ones have room to grow."

"That sounds mean."

"It sounds mean, but it's necessary. If we don't thin them, none of them will grow properly. Sometimes taking care of something means making hard choices."

---

They planted for three days.

Beans. Carrots. Tomatoes that started as tiny seedlings Mama had grown in pots during the journey. Squash seeds that were bigger than Oliver's thumbnail. Lettuce and spinach and herbs whose names Oliver kept forgetting.

By the end, the garden plot was full. Each bed was marked with a stake showing what was planted there. Stakes made by Oliver, just like the stakes he had set for the house.

"Now what?" Thea asked.

"Now we wait," Mama said. "And water. And watch."

---

Waiting was harder than planting.

Every morning, Oliver checked the soil sensors and wrote down the numbers. Every evening, he helped water the beds, carrying buckets from the cistern they had built to catch rainwater. Every day, he looked for any sign of green poking through the brown soil.

For five days, nothing happened.

"Is something wrong?" Oliver asked Mama. "Should something be growing by now?"

Mama smiled. "Seeds take time. They're waking up down there, drinking water, sending out roots. You can't see it, but they're working hard. Give them a few more days."

On the seventh day, Oliver saw the first sprout.

It was a bean plant—a tiny green loop pushing up through the soil, so small he almost missed it. He called for Mama, and they knelt together to look at it.

"There," Mama said softly. "That's life. That's what we planted."

Oliver reached out to touch the sprout, then stopped. It looked fragile. He didn't want to hurt it.

"You can touch it," Mama said. "Gently. Plants are stronger than they look."

He brushed the tiny leaves with his fingertip. They were soft and cool and impossibly delicate. A week ago, this was just a dry seed in a packet. Now it was alive, reaching for the sun, growing.

He had done this. He and Mama and Papa and Thea. They had put seeds in the ground and made life happen.

---

The next few weeks, the garden exploded.

Not all at once—different plants grew at different speeds. The beans came up first, then the lettuce. The carrots took forever, and the tomatoes grew slowly at first and then suddenly got tall.

Oliver recorded everything in his notebook. Which plants grew fastest. Which ones struggled. When he watered, and how much, and what the sensors showed the next morning. He drew pictures of the seedlings at different stages, trying to capture how they changed.

One evening, Penny found him sitting by the garden, notebook open, watching the plants.

"You're becoming a gardener," she said.

"I don't know," Oliver said. "I just like watching them grow. Knowing that we made this happen."

"That's what gardening is. Planting something, caring for it, watching it become more than what you started with." Penny's sensor plates lifted slightly. "Your mother was the same way, when she was your age. She kept notebooks too. Filled them with drawings and numbers and observations."

"Really?"

"She kept them for years. I wonder if she still has them somewhere."

That night, Oliver asked Mama about the notebooks.

She smiled and went to one of the boxes they still hadn't unpacked. She pulled out a stack of small books, worn and faded, held together with a rubber band.

"I forgot I brought these," she said. "I almost left them behind, but I couldn't."

She handed one to Oliver. Inside, in a child's handwriting, were drawings of plants and numbers and observations. Just like his.

"Page thirty-two," Mama said. "I wrote about my first bean plant. I was eight years old."

Oliver turned to page thirty-two. The entry was short:

*The bean came up today!! It has two little leaves. I named it Bernard.*

He laughed. "You named it?"

"I named all of them that first year. Bernard the bean, Clarence the carrot, Tina the tomato." She smiled. "I was very serious about it."

Oliver looked at his own notebook, at the careful measurements and drawings. Maybe he would name his plants too. Not out loud, where anyone could hear. But in his notebook, just for himself.

He turned back to the garden plot, where rows of green were pushing toward the sky.

His plants. His garden. His work.

Growing.
