# Chapter 5: Professional Development Day

Today I decided that if I was going to keep my job as the youngest human in the family, I needed to help someone else learn the skills. Like training a replacement, except not really a replacement, more like an apprentice.

The perfect opportunity came when my cousin Jamie came over for the day. Jamie is five, which makes her very qualified to learn about younger sibling tactics, even though she's an only child.

"Jamie," I said, "how would you like to learn some professional skills?"

"What kind of professional skills?" Jamie asked.

"Younger sibling skills. How to get extra dessert, how to avoid chores, how to get the older kids in trouble instead of you—all the important stuff."

Jamie looked very interested. "Can you really teach me that?"

"I'm an expert," I said. "I've been doing this for seven years."

First, I taught Jamie the art of looking innocent. "The key," I explained, "is to make your eyes very wide and keep your hands where people can see them. Also, if someone asks if you did something, you say, 'I don't think so,' instead of 'no,' because 'I don't think so' isn't technically lying if you're not sure."

"I don't think so," Jamie practiced.

"Perfect! Now let's practice the sad face for when you want something."

I demonstrated my best sad face, the one that usually gets me extra story time. Jamie tried to copy it, but she just looked like she needed to use the bathroom.

"No, no," I said. "You have to think of something actually sad. Like... like when your favorite TV show ends, or when you drop your ice cream."

Jamie tried again. This time she looked genuinely sad, which was actually kind of concerning.

"Are you okay?" I asked.

"I'm thinking about my goldfish that died last month," Jamie said.

"That's too sad! Think of something just a little bit sad. Like when you have to go to bed but you're not tired yet."

"Oh!" Jamie tried again, and this time it was perfect.

"Excellent! Now let's practice on Alex."

We found Alex in the living room reading a book. "Alex," I said, "Jamie wants to ask you something."

Jamie walked up to Alex with her practiced sad face and said, "I don't think so, can I have a cookie?"

Alex looked confused. "You don't think so about what?"

"I don't know," Jamie said, still using the sad face. "Riley said to say that."

Alex looked at me. "Riley, what are you teaching her?"

"Professional development," I said. "Jamie is learning important life skills."

"Those aren't life skills, those are manipulation tactics."

"What's manipulation?" Jamie asked.

"It's when you try to trick people into doing what you want," Alex explained.

"Oh," Jamie said. "I don't want to trick anyone. I just want a cookie."

Alex gave Jamie a cookie, but not because of the sad face—just because Jamie asked nicely and said please.

I tried to continue the training session, but everything kept going wrong. When I taught Jamie how to blame something on an older sibling, Jamie said, "But I don't have an older sibling, and anyway, that seems mean."

When I taught Jamie how to get out of helping with chores by acting helpless, Jamie said, "But I like helping. My mom says helping makes me feel important."

When I taught Jamie how to disappear when trouble was happening, Jamie said, "Wouldn't it be better to help fix the trouble?"

By the end of the day, I realized that all of my professional younger sibling skills seemed kind of... not great when I was trying to teach them to someone else.

"Jamie," I said, "do you think I'm a good teacher?"

"You're a very good teacher," Jamie said. "But I think maybe you're teaching the wrong things."

"What do you mean?"

"I think maybe being the youngest isn't about getting away with stuff. I think it's about getting to learn from everyone older than you."

That night, after Jamie went home, I thought about what she said. Maybe Jamie was right. Maybe I'd been thinking about being the youngest all wrong.

Maybe instead of trying to get away with things, I should be trying to learn things.

But what things? And how?

I guess that's what I need to figure out next.
