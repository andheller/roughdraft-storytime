# Chapter 7: Consulting for the Opposition

Something very weird happened today. Jordan asked me for advice. Not advice about something easy, like what color crayon to use or whether their sandwich needed more peanut butter. Advice about sibling stuff.

It started when Jordan found me in my room reading and said, "Riley, can I ask you something?"

"Sure," I said, "but if this is about the banana song, I already said I was sorry."

"It's not about the banana song. Although that is still stuck in my head and it's been a week."

"Sorry," I said again.

"I need help with Alex and Sam," Jordan said.

This was interesting. Jordan never asked anyone for help, especially not me. Jordan usually just did whatever Jordan wanted to do and dealt with the consequences later.

"What kind of help?" I asked.

"Well," Jordan said, sitting down on my bed, "you're really good at understanding people and figuring out what they want. And I'm really bad at that."

"You are pretty bad at that," I agreed. "Remember when you thought Alex wanted you to reorganize their closet and you put all their clothes in alphabetical order?"

"Alex specifically said they wanted their closet organized!"

"They meant folded, Jordan. Not alphabetized."

"See, this is what I mean," Jordan said. "You would have known that. I never know that."

I felt kind of proud that Jordan thought I was good at understanding people. I'd never thought of it as a skill before, but I guess I do spend a lot of time watching everyone and figuring out how they work.

"So what's the problem?" I asked.

"Alex and Sam are always annoyed with me, and I don't know why. Like yesterday, I tried to help Sam with her math homework, and Sam got mad and said I was being too loud. But I wasn't being loud, I was just being enthusiastic about fractions."

"You were very enthusiastic about fractions," I agreed. "You kept shouting things like 'FRACTIONS ARE JUST DIVISION IN DISGUISE!'"

"Because they are! It's exciting!"

"Maybe Sam doesn't think math is as exciting as you do," I suggested. "Maybe she just wanted quiet help."

"Oh," Jordan said. "I never thought of that."

"And what about Alex?"

"Alex gets mad when I try to help with dinner. Last week I offered to stir the spaghetti sauce and Alex said I was 'getting in the way.'"

"Were you stirring the sauce or were you trying to add ingredients to it?"

"I was adding ingredients. I thought it needed more garlic."

"Alex was probably following a recipe," I explained. "When Alex cooks, they like to follow the recipe exactly. If you want to help Alex, ask what they need you to do instead of just doing what you think needs doing."

Jordan looked amazed. "How do you know all this?"

"I watch people," I said. "It's part of my job as the youngest. I have to understand everyone so I know how to... well, so I know how to get along with them."

We spent the next hour talking about Alex and Sam and how they like to do things. I explained that Alex likes to be in charge when he's cooking or doing projects, so the best way to help Alex is to ask for specific jobs. And I explained that Sam likes quiet time and doesn't like being interrupted, but if you wait for a good moment and ask nicely, Sam is usually happy to help with things.

"This is really helpful," Jordan said. "You should be a professional advice-giver."

"I am a professional," I said. "I'm a professional younger sibling."

"Maybe you could be a professional advice-giver too," Jordan suggested. "You could have two jobs."

That night at dinner, I watched Jordan try out my advice. When Alex was making salad, Jordan asked, "Is there anything specific I can do to help?" instead of just jumping in and adding things. Alex looked surprised but said Jordan could set the table.

And when Sam was trying to read during dinner (which is usually against the rules but Mom was on a work call), Jordan didn't try to start a conversation. Jordan just ate quietly and let Sam read.

Both Alex and Sam seemed less annoyed with Jordan than usual.

After dinner, Alex came to my room and said, "Did you give Jordan advice about how to help me?"

"Maybe," I said.

"It was really good advice. Jordan actually listened when I explained how I wanted the table set instead of just doing it his own way."

"Jordan listens better when you give him specific instructions," I said.

"How did you figure that out?"

"I pay attention," I said.

Alex sat down on my bed, just like Jordan had earlier. "You know, you're really good at understanding people."

"Thanks," I said.

"Maybe instead of trying to get away with things all the time, you could use that skill to help people get along better."

"Maybe," I said. "But I still want to be the youngest."

"You can be both," Alex said. "You can be the youngest and the family advice-giver."

"Is that a real job?"

"It could be," Alex said. "It could be your job."

After Alex left, I thought about having two jobs: professional younger sibling and professional advice-giver. It seemed like a lot of responsibility, but also kind of interesting.

Maybe tomorrow I'd try giving advice to Sam and see how that went.

If I was going to be a professional advice-giver, I should probably practice with everyone.
