# Chapter 10: The Professional Family Member

Today marks exactly one month since I started my new job as a Professional Family Member (Specializing in Youngest Sibling Services and Advice Consultation), and I think it's time to write my final report.

It all started this morning when Mom asked me to help her plan a surprise birthday party for Dad. This was a very important assignment because:
1. I had to coordinate with all my siblings
2. I had to keep a secret for a whole week
3. I had to use my professional skills to figure out what Dad would actually want

"Why are you asking me?" I asked Mom. "Shouldn't Alex plan this since they're the oldest?"

"Alex is good at organizing," Mom said, "but you're good at understanding what people want. And this party needs to be what Dad wants, not what we think he should want."

This was true. Dad is the kind of person who doesn't like big loud parties, but he loves it when the family does things together. He also loves it when we cook his favorite foods and when we play board games that get competitive but not too competitive.

So I called a family meeting to plan the party.

"First," I said, "we need to think about what Dad actually likes, not what we like."

"Dad likes quiet," Sam said.

"Dad likes when we all cook together," Alex added.

"Dad likes beating us at board games," Jordan said.

"Perfect," I said. "So we'll make his favorite dinner together, and then play board games. Nothing loud, nothing fancy, just family stuff."

"That sounds boring," Jordan said.

"It sounds like Dad," I corrected. "And it's Dad's birthday, so it should be what Dad wants."

We spent the week preparing. Alex researched recipes for Dad's favorite foods. Sam found all of Dad's favorite board games and made sure we had all the pieces. Jordan made a card with a drawing of our whole family (Jordan is very good at drawing). And I was in charge of making sure everything stayed a secret and went according to plan.

This was harder than it sounds because Jordan kept almost spoiling the surprise, and Sam kept forgetting that we were supposed to be planning something, and Alex kept trying to make the party more complicated than it needed to be.

"Alex," I said on Wednesday, "we don't need decorations. Dad doesn't like decorations."

"But it's a party," Alex said. "Parties need decorations."

"This isn't that kind of party," I explained. "This is a Dad party. Dad parties just need family and food and games."

"How do you know so much about what Dad likes?" Alex asked.

"I watch him," I said. "When we have big parties with decorations, Dad spends most of the time cleaning up. When we just hang out as a family, Dad looks happy and relaxed."

"You're right," Alex said. "Okay, no decorations."

On Friday night, we surprised Dad with the party. We cooked his favorite dinner (spaghetti with meat sauce, garlic bread, and salad), and then we played board games for three hours. Dad won two games and came in second in the third game, which made him very happy.

"This is the best birthday party I've ever had," Dad said when we were cleaning up.

"Really?" Jordan asked. "But we didn't have decorations or a theme or anything."

"I don't need decorations," Dad said. "I just need my family."

"Riley planned it," Alex said. "Riley figured out what you'd actually want."

"Riley is very good at understanding people," Dad said, giving me a hug.

Later that night, when everyone else had gone to bed, I sat in my room and thought about my new job. I wasn't just the youngest anymore. I wasn't just the advice-giver. I was the person in the family who paid attention to what everyone needed and tried to help them get it.

Being the youngest had been about what I could get away with. Being a Professional Family Member was about what I could do for other people.

The weird thing was, I liked my new job better than my old job. Getting away with things was fun sometimes, but helping people was fun all the time. And when I helped people, they were happy, which made me happy, which made everyone happy.

Also, I still got extra dessert sometimes because I was the youngest, and I still got to sit in the front seat when Alex wasn't in the car, and I still got picked first for hugs when people were sad. Being the youngest came with some benefits that didn't go away just because I had other jobs too.

Tomorrow I'm going to ask Mom if I can have business cards made. They would say:
