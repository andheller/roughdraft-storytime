# Chapter 2: The Older Sibling Convention

I take back everything I said about not being worried. Today was the worst day in my professional career, and it's all because my older siblings apparently had some kind of secret meeting without me.

It started at breakfast when I asked Alex to pass the cereal and Alex said, "Get it yourself, you have arms." Which was weird because usually Alex just passes things automatically. Alex is very into being helpful, probably because he's the oldest and thinks that's his job.

Then Sam, who never talks at breakfast because Sam is not a morning person, actually looked up from her phone and said, "Yeah, Riley, you can reach it." And Jordan, who usually steals my cereal, actually pushed the box toward me instead of taking it.

This was suspicious. Very suspicious.

The suspicion got worse when I asked Mom if I could have a friend over and she said I had to ask my siblings first. I said, "Why do I have to ask them?" and she said, "Because Alex is in charge while I'm at work today."

Alex being in charge is normal. Alex being in charge while Sam and Jordan nod like they agree with this plan is not normal. Sam and Jordan never agree with anything Alex says. Ever. One time Alex said the sky was blue and Jordan argued that it was more of a turquoise.

So I went upstairs to ask Alex about having a friend over, and Alex said, "Sure, but you have to clean your room first, and Jordan's room, and help Sam organize her bookshelf."

"That's not fair," I said. "I never have to clean Jordan's room."

"New rules," Sam said, appearing in the doorway like a bookshelf-organizing ninja. "We decided that if you want privileges, you have to earn them."

"Since when do you three agree on anything?" I asked.

"Since we realized we're tired of you getting away with everything just because you're the youngest," Jordan said. "We had a meeting."

A MEETING. Without me. About me.

This was definitely against professional younger sibling regulations, but I wasn't sure which regulation exactly because I don't think anyone's ever written them down. Maybe I should work on that.

I tried my usual tactics. First, I went to Mom with a very sad face and said that my siblings were being mean to me. But Mom said that it sounded like they were just trying to teach me responsibility, which is something I've been avoiding learning for seven years.

Then I tried being extra cute with Dad, but Dad said that maybe it would be good for me to help out more around the house. Apparently, Alex had already talked to him about this "plan." The three older ones had actually organized a presentation. A presentation! About me! Without me!

By dinner time, I had cleaned two rooms, organized a bookshelf, and helped fold laundry, and I still hadn't gotten to have my friend over because Sam decided I hadn't done the bookshelf correctly and made me redo it.

"This is mutiny," I announced at dinner.

"It's not mutiny," Alex said. "It's cooperation."

"I don't want to cooperate," I said. "I want to be the youngest."

"You're still the youngest," Jordan said. "You just don't get to act like a baby anymore."

"I don't act like a baby!"

"You cried yesterday because I was breathing too loud," Sam pointed out.

"That was a very loud breathing situation," I said, but I could tell I was losing this argument.

After dinner, I went to my room to think about this problem. Clearly, I needed a new strategy. My usual younger sibling tactics weren't working against a united front of older siblings.

Maybe it was time for some advanced training.

Or maybe it was time to figure out what they really wanted and give them something completely different.

I'm not sure yet, but tomorrow I'm going to start researching other professional younger siblings to see how they handle older sibling conventions. There has to be a way to get my job back.

There has to be.
