# Chapter 6: The Great Sibling Strike

Today something happened that has never happened before in the history of our family: all four of us got in trouble together. At the same time. For the same thing.

It started because Jordan decided to reorganize Mom's home office as a "surprise" while she was at work. Jordan meant well, but Jordan's idea of organizing is very different from everyone else's idea of organizing. Jordan organized everything by color instead of by what it was, so all the blue things were together, and all the red things were together, but Mom's important work papers were scattered everywhere.

When Mom came home and saw her office, she was not happy. She was the opposite of happy. She was the kind of not-happy where her voice gets very quiet and she uses everyone's full names.

"Alexandra. Samuel. Jordan. Riley. Living room. Now."

We all sat on the couch in a row, from oldest to youngest, which is how we always sit when we're in Big Trouble.

"Which one of you reorganized my office?" Mom asked.

Jordan started to raise his hand, but then Alex kicked him under the coffee table.

"We don't know," Alex said.

This was a lie. We all knew it was Jordan because Jordan had been talking about wanting to surprise Mom all week. But for some reason, Alex decided we should all lie about it.

"We were all here together," Sam added. "All afternoon."

This was also a lie. I had been at Jamie's house until four o'clock, and Sam had been at soccer practice until five. But apparently we were all lying now.

"I don't think so," I said, trying to use the technique I taught Jamie.

Mom looked at all of us for a long time. "So you're telling me that none of you know how my office got reorganized by color, even though Jordan has been talking about reorganizing things by color for the past month?"

We all nodded.

"And you were all here together all afternoon, even though Riley was at Jamie's house and Sam was at soccer practice?"

We all nodded again, but less confidently.

"I see," Mom said. "Well, since you were all here together, and none of you know anything about my office, you can all help me put it back together. Tonight. Before dinner."

This was a disaster. Usually, when Jordan got in trouble, the rest of us got to sit back and watch. This was the first time my usual "I don't know anything" strategy had backfired.

We spent three hours putting Mom's office back the way it was supposed to be. Jordan kept apologizing and saying he just wanted to help, but the rest of us were too annoyed to be sympathetic.

"Why did you lie for me?" Jordan asked while we were sorting through a pile of paper clips and rubber bands.

"Because that's what siblings do," Alex said. "We stick together."

"But now we're all in trouble," Sam pointed out.

"Yeah," I said. "This is not how being the youngest is supposed to work. Usually, I get to watch everyone else get in trouble while I eat a snack."

"Welcome to being part of the team," Alex said.

"I don't want to be part of the team," I said. "I want to be the youngest."

"You can't be both?" Jordan asked.

"I don't think so," I said. "Being the youngest means being separate. Being part of the team means being together."

"Why can't you be the youngest member of the team?" Sam asked.

I thought about this while I organized a pile of pens. Could I be both? Could I be the youngest AND be part of the team?

When we finally finished cleaning up Mom's office, she called us all back to the living room.

"I know Jordan reorganized my office," she said. "And I know the rest of you were trying to protect Jordan, which was very sweet. But lying to me is not okay, even when you're trying to help each other."

We all apologized, and Jordan apologized extra because it was their fault to begin with.

"However," Mom continued, "I am proud of you for sticking together as siblings. That's exactly what families are supposed to do."

After Mom left, the four of us sat on the couch for a while longer.

"So," Alex said, "are we friends again?"

"Were we not friends before?" I asked.

"We were having that older sibling convention against you," Jordan reminded me.

"Oh, right. That."

"Maybe we can try a different approach," Sam suggested. "Like, Riley is still the youngest, but Riley also helps out more."

"And we don't gang up on Riley," Alex added, "but Riley doesn't try to get us in trouble just for fun."

"Deal," I said. "But I still get extra dessert sometimes because I'm the youngest."

"Fine," everyone agreed.

"And I still get to sit in the front seat when Alex isn't in the car."

"That's just safety rules," Alex said. "That's not a youngest privilege."

"Oh. Well, I still get to pick the movie on family movie night."

"We all take turns picking the movie," Sam said.

"Oh."

Maybe being the youngest didn't come with as many privileges as I thought it did. But being part of a team might come with different kinds of privileges.

I guess I'm about to find out.
