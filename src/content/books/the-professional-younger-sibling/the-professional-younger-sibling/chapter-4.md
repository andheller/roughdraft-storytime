# Chapter 4: The Substitute Youngest

Today something terrible happened. Our dog, Biscuit, started acting like the youngest member of the family.

I should have seen this coming. Biscuit is technically younger than me—he's only three in dog years, which I think makes him like twenty-one in human years, but he acts like a baby. And everyone thinks it's cute.

It started at breakfast when Biscuit sat next to Mom's chair and gave her the sad eyes. You know the look—the one where his eyes get all big and pitiful and he tilts his head just a little bit. Mom immediately gave Biscuit a piece of her toast.

"That's my move," I said. "Sad eyes at breakfast is my thing."

"Dogs invented sad eyes," Jordan said. "You probably learned it from watching Biscuit."

This was ridiculous. I've been perfecting my sad eyes since I was two years old. Biscuit just has natural sad eyes because he's a golden retriever and that's how his face is shaped.

But it got worse. When Alex was doing homework at the kitchen table, Biscuit came over and put his head on Alex's lap. Alex immediately started petting him and saying, "Aw, does someone want attention?"

When I tried the same thing—putting my head on Alex's other leg—Alex said, "Riley, what are you doing? I'm trying to concentrate."

"Biscuit got attention for doing that," I pointed out.

"Biscuit is a dog."

"So?"

"So you're not."

This seemed like discrimination against non-dogs, but I wasn't sure how to argue that point.

The final straw came at dinner when Biscuit sat under the table and somehow managed to get food from everyone. Jordan dropped a piece of chicken "accidentally." Sam "accidentally" dropped a green bean. Even Alex gave Biscuit a bite of mashed potatoes when Mom wasn't looking.

I tried sitting under the table too, but Mom just said, "Riley, get back in your chair and eat your dinner like a human being."

"But Biscuit gets to eat under the table!"

"Biscuit IS NOT a human being."

"Neither is Jordan most of the time," I muttered, but apparently I didn't mutter quietly enough because Jordan flicked a pea at me.

After dinner, I had a serious talk with Biscuit in my room.

"Look," I said, "I know you don't understand most of what I'm saying, but you're taking my job."

Biscuit wagged his tail and licked my face.

"See, that's exactly what I mean. You're being cute without even trying, and it's making me look bad."

Biscuit tilted his head to the side, which was annoyingly adorable.

"Fine," I said. "If you're going to act like the youngest, then I'll act like... like... a middle child!"

This turned out to be harder than I thought. Sam is very good at being a middle child because Sam has perfected the art of being invisible when it's convenient and noticeable when she wants something. But when I tried to be invisible during chore time, Mom found me immediately.

"Riley, why are you hiding behind the couch?"

"I'm being a middle child."

"That's not how being a middle child works."

"How would you know? You're not a middle child."

"I was a middle child, actually."

This was news to me. "Really?"

"Really. And middle children don't hide behind couches. They just develop very good negotiation skills."

"What kind of negotiation skills?"

"Well," Mom said, sitting down next to me behind the couch, "middle children are very good at finding compromises. Like, maybe Biscuit can be the baby of the family sometimes, and you can be the baby of the family sometimes, and sometimes you can both just be yourselves."

"But I like being the youngest," I said. "It's my job."

"Maybe your job is changing," Mom said. "Maybe now your job is being Riley, who happens to be the youngest human in the family."

"What's the difference?"

"Well, being the youngest was about what you could get away with. Being Riley is about what you can do."

I thought about this while Mom went to start the dishwasher. Maybe she was right. Maybe I didn't have to compete with Biscuit for the youngest position. Maybe I could have my own position.

Later that night, I shared my dinner roll with Biscuit and taught him how to shake hands. He already knew how, but I pretended like I was training him so I could feel useful.

"You can be the youngest dog," I told him. "And I'll be the youngest human. We can both have important jobs."

Biscuit wagged his tail, which I decided meant he agreed with this plan.

Though I'm still working on what exactly my new job description is going to be.
