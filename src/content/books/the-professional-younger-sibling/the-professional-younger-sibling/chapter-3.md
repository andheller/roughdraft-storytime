# Chapter 3: Field Research

Today I decided to conduct field research on other younger siblings to see if they had any advanced techniques I could use. I figured if I was going to get my professional status back, I needed to learn from the experts.

First, I studied my friend Maya, who is the youngest of three. At lunch, I watched her ask her older brother to open her juice box. He just did it, no questions asked. When I asked her what her secret was, she said, "I don't know, I just ask nicely."

Just ask nicely? That seemed too simple. There had to be more to it.

So I tested this theory when I got home. I found Alex in the kitchen and said, very nicely, "Alex, could you please make me a snack?"

Alex looked at me suspiciously. "Why are you talking like that?"

"Like what?"

"Like you're trying to sell me something."

Apparently, asking nicely only works if you're naturally nice, not if you're trying to be strategically nice. I made a mental note: Natural niceness beats fake niceness.

Next, I observed Tommy from my class, who is the youngest of five kids. At recess, he told me his strategy was to be so annoying that his siblings would do things for him just to make him stop.

"Like what?" I asked.

"Like this," he said, and then started singing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" but replacing all the words with "banana." It was very annoying.

I tried this technique on Jordan while he was doing homework. I sat next to him and started singing "Banana, banana, little banana, how I banana what you banana."

Jordan lasted exactly thirty-seven seconds before saying, "STOP. What do you want?"

"Can you help me with my math homework?"

"Fine, just STOP SINGING."

This technique worked, but I felt like it might damage my professional reputation. Also, Sam came over and said if I didn't stop the banana song, she was going to hide all my books, which seemed like a threat I should take seriously since Sam knows where I keep everything.

My third research subject was Lucy, who lives next door and is the youngest of twins. She said her strategy was to be the "good twin" while her brother was the "trouble twin."

"But what if you want to cause trouble sometimes?" I asked.

"Then I blame it on him," she said. "No one ever suspects the good twin."

This seemed promising until I realized I don't have a twin to blame things on. Jordan is already the trouble sibling in our family, but they're three years older than me, so blaming them for something I did would be pretty obvious.

Finally, I talked to Mrs. Peterson next door, who said when she was little and the youngest of six, her strategy was to be so helpful that her parents couldn't imagine life without her.

"I volunteered for everything," she said. "Dishes, laundry, babysitting the chickensâ€”"

"You had chickens?"

"Different times, sweetie. The point is, I made myself indispensable."

That night at dinner, I announced that I wanted to be more helpful around the house.

Everyone stopped eating and stared at me.

"What's the catch?" Sam asked.

"No catch," I said. "I just want to be a good family member."

"Are you feeling okay?" Mom asked, putting her hand on my forehead. "You don't have a fever..."

"I'm fine! I just want to help!"

"Okay," Alex said slowly. "You can help me with the dishes after dinner."

"Great!" I said. "How hard could dishes be?"

Famous last words. Dishes are very hard. First, I dropped a plate, which didn't break but made a very loud noise. Then I used too much soap and bubbles got everywhere. Then I accidentally sprayed Alex with the sink sprayer thing.

"Are you sure you want to be helpful?" Alex asked, wiping soap bubbles out of his hair.

"I'm still learning," I said. "Tomorrow I'll be much better at this."

Alex looked doubtful, but he let me finish the dishes. Well, they finished the dishes while I dried them and only dropped two more things.

Later, when I was going to bed, I realized something important: all the other younger siblings I talked to had developed their strategies naturally, over time. I was trying to copy their methods instead of figuring out what worked for me.

Maybe tomorrow I should stop researching other people and start figuring out what kind of professional younger sibling I actually want to be.

But first, I should probably apologize to Jordan for the banana song. They're still humming it, and it's been four hours.
