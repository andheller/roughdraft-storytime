# Chapter 9: Advanced Sibling Relations

Today I had to use all my professional skills to help solve the biggest sibling crisis in our family's history. And for the first time, nobody cared that I was the youngestâ€”they just cared that I might be able to help.

It started when Alex came home from school crying, which never happens because Alex is fifteen and fifteen-year-olds don't usually cry about school things. At least, Alex doesn't usually cry about school things.

"What's wrong?" Mom asked, but Alex just shook his head and went upstairs.

Jordan immediately wanted to go ask Alex what happened, but I stopped him.

"Wait," I said. "When people are upset, sometimes they need a few minutes before they want to talk about it."

"How do you know that?" Jordan asked.

"I pay attention," I said. "Alex always needs a few minutes to think before talking about big things."

So we waited. After about ten minutes, I went upstairs and knocked on Alex's door.

"Alex? Do you want to talk?"

"Not really," Alex said, but he opened the door anyway.

"Do you want to not talk but have someone sit with you?" I asked.

Alex smiled a little bit. "Yeah, okay."

I sat on Alex's bed while he put away his backpack and organized his desk, which is what Alex does when he's thinking through a problem.

"School stuff?" I asked.

"Friend stuff," Alex said. "My best friend Madison is mad at me, and I don't know why. She won't talk to me, and when I asked her what was wrong, she said I should know."

"But you don't know?"

"I have no idea," Alex said. "I've been thinking about it all day, and I can't figure out what I did."

This seemed like a job for someone who was good at understanding people and figuring out what they needed.

"Do you want me to help you think through it?" I asked.

"How would you help?" Alex asked.

"I could ask you questions about what happened, and maybe we could figure it out together."

Alex looked surprised. "You want to help me with friend problems?"

"I'm good at people problems," I said. "It's one of my professional skills."

So Alex told me about everything that had happened with Madison over the past week. They had eaten lunch together every day, worked on a project together, and hung out at Madison's house on Wednesday. Everything seemed normal until Friday, when Madison started ignoring Alex.

"What happened on Wednesday?" I asked. "When you were at her house?"

"We worked on our history presentation. Madison had this idea for how to organize it, but I thought my way was better, so we did it my way."

"How did Madison react when you said your way was better?"

"She said okay," Alex said. "She seemed fine with it."

"Did she seem actually fine, or did she seem like she was pretending to be fine?"

Alex thought about this. "Maybe... pretending to be fine?"

"And then what happened?"

"We finished the project, and I went home."

"Did you say anything about her idea? Like, did you say it was good even though you didn't use it?"

Alex looked uncomfortable. "No, I just... we used my idea and finished the project."

"So Madison had an idea, you said your idea was better, you used your idea, and then you didn't say anything nice about her idea?"

"When you put it like that, it sounds bad," Alex said.

"It's not bad," I said. "But maybe Madison felt like her ideas don't matter to you."

"But they do matter!" Alex said. "I just thought my idea was better for that project."

"Did you tell her that her idea mattered?"

"No," Alex said quietly.

"Maybe that's what you should tell her," I suggested.

Alex looked thoughtful. "You think I should apologize?"

"I think you should tell her the truth," I said. "That you think her ideas are good, and you're sorry you didn't say that, and you want to keep being friends."

"What if she's still mad?"

"Then at least you'll know you tried," I said. "And Madison will know that you care about her feelings."

Alex hugged me, which was unexpected but nice.

"Thank you, Riley," Alex said. "You're really good at this advice thing."

"I know," I said. "It's my new professional specialty."

The next day, Alex came home from school smiling.

"Madison and I are friends again," Alex announced at dinner. "I apologized for not appreciating her idea, and she said she was mad because she felt like I thought I was smarter than her."

"Are you smarter than her?" Jordan asked.

"We're both smart in different ways," Alex said. "Which is what I should have said in the first place."

"How did you figure out what to say?" Sam asked.

"Riley helped me," Alex said. "Riley is really good at understanding people."

Mom and Dad looked at me with proud expressions.

"Is that so?" Dad said.

"It's part of my job," I explained. "I'm a professional advice-giver now, in addition to being the youngest."

"That sounds like an important job," Mom said.

"It is," I said. "And the best part is, I'm the only one in the family qualified to do it."

"What makes you qualified?" Jordan asked.

"I pay attention to people," I said. "And I'm good at figuring out what they need. Plus, I'm the youngest, so I have a lot of experience with family dynamics."

"Those are very good qualifications," Dad said.

That night, I updated my professional resume in my head:

Riley, Age 7
Professional Younger Sibling and Family Advice Specialist
- Seven years of experience in family dynamics
- Expert in understanding people's feelings and needs
- Skilled in conflict resolution and sibling relations
- Excellent at making people feel better when they're sad
- Still very cute when necessary

I think this might be the best job combination ever.
