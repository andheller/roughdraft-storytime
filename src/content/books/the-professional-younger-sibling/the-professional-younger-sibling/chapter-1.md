# Chapter 1: My Professional Qualifications

My name is Riley and I have the best job in the world. I am a professional younger sibling, which means I get paid in extra dessert and staying up late sometimes. Well, not really paid, but you know what I mean.

I have been doing this job for seven years now, which is my whole life, so I think I'm pretty much an expert. My older siblings are Alex who is fifteen and thinks he knows everything (he doesn't), Sam who is twelve and is really good at disappearing when chores need doing (I respect this skill), and Jordan who is ten and gets in trouble a lot (which is actually very helpful for my career).

Being the youngest is not just about being cute, although I am very cute. It's about strategy. For example, when everyone gets in trouble for something, I have perfected the art of looking confused and saying, "I don't understand what happened." This works about eighty percent of the time, which in professional terms is called "a very good success rate."

Last Tuesday, someone (definitely not me) may have accidentally put salt in the sugar container instead of sugar. When Mom's coffee tasted terrible and she asked who did it, Alex immediately started yelling about how Jordan always messes with stuff in the kitchen. Jordan started yelling back that Sam probably did it because Sam likes pranks. Sam just shrugged and said, "Wasn't me," which is Sam's response to everything.

Meanwhile, I just sat there eating my cereal and looking like I had never seen a salt container in my life. Mom looked at all of us and said, "Well, Riley obviously didn't do it," and made Alex and Jordan clean the entire kitchen as punishment.

See? Professional younger sibling skills at work.

Another important part of my job is knowing when to be helpful and when to be helpless. If Alex asks me to help carry something heavy, I suddenly become too small and weak. But if Mom asks me to help set the table, I am very capable and responsible. It's all about reading the situation.

The best part of being a professional younger sibling is that everyone expects you to not know things, so when you do know things, they're super impressed. Like yesterday when I told Dad that his car was making a weird noise and he should check the engine. He was so surprised that I noticed that he gave me an extra story at bedtime. I didn't mention that I only noticed because Jordan told me earlier that Dad's car sounded funny, but that's just good information management.

Jordan said I'm sneaky, but I prefer to think of myself as strategic. There's a difference. Sneaky is when you do something bad and try not to get caught. Strategic is when you do something smart and it works out well for everyone. Mostly for me, but everyone benefits from me being happy.

Tomorrow, Alex starts high school, which means there might be some changes in our family system. But I'm not worried. I've been training for this my whole career. Besides, I'm pretty sure being the youngest is a permanent position.

At least, I hope it is.
