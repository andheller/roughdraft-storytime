# Chapter 8: The Retirement Plan

Today I found out that my job as the youngest family member might be ending soon. Not because I'm getting older, but because we might be getting someone younger.

It started when Aunt Kelly called Mom to ask if we could babysit my baby cousin Max for the weekend while she and Uncle Pete went to a wedding. Max is eight months old, which makes him much younger than me, and according to family rules, that would make him the youngest.

"It's just for two nights," Mom told us at dinner. "Max is a very good baby, and Aunt Kelly is bringing everything we need."

"Where will Max sleep?" Sam asked.

"In our room, in his portable crib," Mom said.

"Will he cry a lot?" Jordan asked.

"He might cry some," Mom said. "Babies cry when they need things."

"Will I still be the youngest?" I asked.

Everyone looked at me.

"What do you mean?" Mom asked.

"I mean, Max is younger than me, so while he's here, am I still the youngest, or is he the youngest?"

"You're both young," Mom said diplomatically.

"But only one of us can be THE youngest," I pointed out.

"Riley," Alex said, "Max is a baby. He doesn't know how to be the youngest. He just knows how to eat and sleep and cry."

"Those are very important youngest sibling skills," I said.

"But he doesn't know how to ask for extra dessert or get out of chores," Jordan added.

"Yet," I said. "But what if he's naturally good at it? What if he's better at being the youngest than I am?"

That night, I made a list of all my professional younger sibling skills so I could teach them to Max if needed, or compare them to his natural abilities to see who was better at the job.

My Professional Younger Sibling Skills:
1. Sad eyes for getting extra dessert
2. Looking innocent when in trouble  
3. Being cute when I need help with something
4. Knowing when to be helpless and when to be helpful
5. Understanding what everyone in the family needs
6. Giving advice to siblings who need it
7. Making people laugh when they're grumpy

When Max arrived on Friday afternoon, I was ready to evaluate his competition level.

Max turned out to be very good at some youngest sibling skills and terrible at others. He was excellent at getting attention just by existing—everyone wanted to hold him and talk to him in funny voices. He was also very good at getting people to bring him things, although he didn't have to ask because adults just automatically brought him bottles and toys and clean diapers.

But Max was terrible at strategic timing. He cried when Mom was trying to cook dinner, which made Mom stressed instead of sympathetic. And he couldn't understand instructions, so when Sam tried to show him a book, Max just grabbed it and tried to eat it.

"He's not very good at this," I told Mom while we watched Max bang a rattle against his car seat.

"Not very good at what?" Mom asked.

"Being the youngest. He doesn't understand the strategy."

"I don't think Max is trying to be strategic, sweetie. He's just being a baby."

"But being a baby is the most important part of being the youngest," I said.

"Is it?" Mom asked. "Is that what you think your job is? Being a baby?"

I thought about this. "Not exactly. But acting like a baby when it's helpful."

"And what about the other things you do? Like helping Jordan understand Alex and Sam better, or noticing when Dad is tired and needs someone to make him laugh?"

"Those aren't youngest sibling things," I said. "Those are just... Riley things."

"Maybe Riley things are more important than youngest sibling things," Mom said.

That evening, I decided to test this theory. When Max started crying during dinner and Mom looked stressed, I didn't try to get attention for myself. Instead, I got up and found Max's favorite toy—a little stuffed elephant—and gave it to him. He stopped crying and started chewing on the elephant's ear.

"Thank you, Riley," Mom said. "That was very helpful."

"I know what Max likes," I said. "I've been watching him."

"You're very good at watching people and figuring out what they need," Dad said.

Later, when Alex was trying to do homework while Max was being fussy, I offered to walk around the living room with Max so Alex could concentrate. Max liked being walked around, and Alex got their homework done.

"You're really good with babies," Alex said.

"I'm good with people," I said. "Max is people, just small people."

By Sunday, when Aunt Kelly came to pick up Max, I realized something important. Max was definitely younger than me, but that didn't make him better at being a family member. He was good at being a baby, but I was good at being Riley.

"Did you have fun being a big cousin?" Aunt Kelly asked me.

"I wasn't being a big cousin," I said. "I was being a helpful family member."

"Is there a difference?" she asked.

"I think so," I said. "Being a big cousin is about age. Being a helpful family member is about what you do."

After Max left, our house felt very quiet.

"Do you miss being the only youngest?" Sam asked me.

"No," I said, and I was surprised to realize I meant it. "I think I like being the youngest helpful family member better than just being the youngest."

"What's the difference?" Jordan asked.

"The difference is that now I have a job that no one can take away from me," I said. "Even if we get another baby in the family, I'll still be the only Riley."

"That's very wise," Alex said.

"Thank you," I said. "I've been practicing being wise. It's part of my new job description."
