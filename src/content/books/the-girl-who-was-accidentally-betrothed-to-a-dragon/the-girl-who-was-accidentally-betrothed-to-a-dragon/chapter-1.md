# The Invitation List

The year that Lady Wren Fitzgerald turned seventeen, she was the fourteenth most eligible young woman in the kingdom of Briarwell. This was a significant improvement from the previous year, when she had ranked twenty-third, largely due to her unfortunate habit of correcting adults about beetles.

"That's not a ladybug," she had told the Duchess of Pemberton at last year's Spring Ball. "That's a *Harmonia axyridis*, the Asian lady beetle. You can tell by the M-shaped marking on the pronotum. Ladybugs have spots that are more—"

The Duchess had walked away somewhere around "pronotum."

But by seventeen, Wren had learned (mostly) to keep her beetle observations to herself, and her ranking had improved accordingly. Not that Wren cared about rankings. Wren cared about beetles, and about being left alone, and about her collection of mounted specimens that took up three entire rooms of the east wing, much to her mother's despair.

"You could use those rooms for *embroidery*," Lady Fitzgerald often said.

"I could," Wren agreed. "I won't, but I could."

The trouble began, as troubles often do, with an administrative error.

To understand what happened, you must first understand the Royal Betrothal Office, which has existed in Briarwell for four hundred and twenty-seven years and has, in that time, accumulated a reputation for legendary incompetence. The Office occupies the third floor of the Palace's east wing, where seventeen clerks work very slowly on matters of tremendous importance.

The most famous error in the Office's history occurred in 1847, when a clerk named Marmaduke Pennywhistle accidentally betrothed a countess to a particularly nice hat. (The hat was the property of Viscount Alderton, who was quite attached to it, and the resulting legal battle lasted seven years. The countess eventually won custody of the hat on alternate weekends.) Other notable errors include the Great Misfiling of 1862, in which forty-three betrothals were recorded using invisible ink (they had run out of the regular kind), and the unfortunate incident of 1901, when a clerk's pet ferret ate an entire drawer of pending applications.

But none of these errors quite compared to what Marmaduke Pennywhistle's great-great-grandson, also named Marmaduke Pennywhistle (the family lacked imagination), did on the day of Wren's birth.

Wren's parents had, like all noble families, submitted a Preliminary Betrothal Interest Form within hours of her birth. This was standard practice. The form was simple: it stated that Lord and Lady Fitzgerald wished to register their daughter for future betrothal consideration, and it requested a match with any suitable party of noble standing, good character, and reasonable proximity.

The elder Marmaduke Pennywhistle had processed thousands of such forms without incident. The younger Marmaduke, however, had recently taken up a hobby.

The hobby was exotic fauna.

On the particular day when Wren's form arrived, young Marmaduke was reading a fascinating treatise on the social habits of dragons. Dragons, he had learned, were not the fire-breathing terrors of legend, but rather scholarly creatures who lived in the Ashenmount Mountains and spent most of their time arguing about geology. They had their own universities, their own tenure committees, and their own rather complicated marriage customs.

"How interesting," Marmaduke had muttered, turning a page with one hand while reaching for the next form in his pile with the other.

He had stamped the form without looking.

He had filed it without reading.

And he had, in doing so, betrothed the newborn Lady Wren Fitzgerald to "Cornelius, of the Ashenmount Estate"—a dragon who was, at that very moment, defending his dissertation on volcanic mineral deposits to a panel of extremely critical elder dragons.

Cornelius had not been consulted about this arrangement.

Neither, for that matter, had Wren's parents.

The form had simply... vanished into the vast paper wilderness of the Royal Betrothal Office, where it remained undisturbed for seventeen years, until someone thought to look up the invitation list for Wren's eighteenth birthday celebration.

"Mother," Wren said, looking up from the draft invitation list that had been placed on her breakfast plate. "Why is there a dragon on my guest list?"

Lady Fitzgerald was arranging flowers and did not turn around. "Don't be silly, dear. There's no dragon on your guest list."

"There is. Right here. 'Cornelius of Ashenmount, the betrothed.'" Wren frowned. "What does 'the betrothed' mean?"

The vase Lady Fitzgerald was holding made a sound that vases should not make when they hit the floor.

"Let me see that," Lady Fitzgerald said, in a voice that had gone very quiet and very careful.

Wren handed over the list.

There was a long silence.

"Harold!" Lady Fitzgerald called, in the voice she used when someone was about to be in considerable trouble. "HAROLD!"

Lord Fitzgerald appeared in the doorway, looking alarmed. He had been in his study, doing whatever it was that lords did in studies (Wren suspected it involved napping, but she couldn't prove it). "What is it? What's happened? Is something on fire?"

"Nothing is on fire. Yet." Lady Fitzgerald thrust the paper at him. "Explain this."

Lord Fitzgerald read the paper. His face went through several interesting colors.

"Ah," he said.

"'Ah'? That's all you have to say? *Ah*?"

"Well, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation—"

"Our daughter is betrothed to a DRAGON, Harold!"

"Perhaps it's a typo?"

"A typo of what? What word could they possibly have meant that came out as DRAGON?"

Lord Fitzgerald thought about this. "Wagon?"

"She's not betrothed to a WAGON either!"

Wren, who had been watching this exchange with growing interest, raised a hand. "I have a question."

Both parents turned to look at her.

"Is this legally binding?"

Another silence, this one even longer than the first.

"I'll send for the lawyers," Lord Fitzgerald said quietly, and left the room.

The lawyers arrived at noon. There were three of them, all wearing identical expressions of barely suppressed horror.

"It's... unprecedented," said the first lawyer.

"It's quite irregular," said the second lawyer.

"It's completely valid," said the third lawyer, who was the most junior and therefore the most honest. "According to the Betrothal Registry Act of 1723, any agreement filed and stamped by an authorized clerk of the Royal Betrothal Office is legally binding upon both parties, their heirs, and their estates, in perpetuity."

"But one of the parties is a DRAGON," Lady Fitzgerald said.

"The Act does not specify species," the third lawyer said, flipping through a very old book. "It merely requires that both parties be 'of sound mind and reasonable estate.' Dragons, as it happens, are quite wealthy. Something about sitting on hoards of gold. And the Ashenmount dragons are known to be particularly sound of mind—one of them won the Briarwell Prize for Mathematics last year."

"Surely there must be some way to dissolve this arrangement," Lord Fitzgerald said.

The lawyers exchanged looks.

"There is... one possibility," the first lawyer admitted. "But it would require the approval of the Office's Senior Clerk. A woman named Ms. Parchment."

"Then let's contact her immediately!"

"She's on holiday. She takes her annual leave very seriously. She won't be back for three weeks."

"THREE WEEKS?"

"She's visiting her sister in the Outer Isles. There's no way to reach her."

Wren, who had been silent through most of this, stood up. "Excuse me."

Everyone turned to look at her.

"While you're all panicking," she said, "has anyone thought to ask the dragon how he feels about this?"

The lawyers stared. Her parents stared. Nobody, it seemed, had considered this.

"Because if I've learned anything from cataloging beetles," Wren continued, "it's that you shouldn't assume things about a creature until you've actually observed it. For all we know, the dragon is just as horrified as we are." She paused. "Probably more. I've heard dragons are very particular about protocol."

"You can't just... go talk to a dragon," Lady Fitzgerald said.

"Why not?"

"It's... it's not DONE."

"Neither is accidentally being betrothed to one, but here we are." Wren folded her arms. "I'm going to Ashenmount. I'm going to find this Cornelius. And I'm going to sort this out."

Lord Fitzgerald opened his mouth, probably to object.

Wren fixed him with the look she used on particularly stubborn beetle specimens.

He closed his mouth.

"Take the carriage," he said weakly. "And maybe a guard. Or twelve."

"I'll take one guard," Wren said. "And my specimen bag. If I'm going to the Ashenmount Mountains, I might as well collect some volcanic beetles."

And that, as they say, is how the adventure began—with a clerical error, a missed checkbox, and a seventeen-year-old girl who was considerably more practical than anyone gave her credit for.

The dragon, as it turned out, was about to have a very bad day.

But then again, so was Wren.
