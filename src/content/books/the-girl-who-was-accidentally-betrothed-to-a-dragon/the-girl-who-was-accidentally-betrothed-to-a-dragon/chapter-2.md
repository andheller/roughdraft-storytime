# The Meeting

The Ashenmount Mountains were, as mountains go, rather more dramatic than strictly necessary. They loomed. They brooded. They were perpetually wreathed in a kind of moody mist that seemed designed specifically to make travelers feel unwelcome.

Wren found them fascinating.

"Look at that basalt formation," she said, pressing her face against the carriage window. "The columnar jointing is magnificent. I bet there are Buprestidae beetles in there. The metallic wood-borers love volcanic rock."

The guard, whose name was Bernard and who had been chosen for this mission primarily because he was the only one who hadn't pretended to be sick, said nothing. Bernard had learned in the first hour of the journey that Lady Wren did not require responses to her observations about beetles. She would simply continue making them whether anyone was listening or not.

The carriage wound its way up a narrow mountain path, past warning signs that became increasingly urgent.

DRAGON TERRITORY AHEAD.

NO TRESPASSING.

SERIOUSLY, TURN AROUND.

THIS MEANS YOU.

FINE, BUT DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU.

"Friendly," Wren remarked.

The path ended at an enormous cave entrance, flanked by two statues of dragons in what appeared to be academic regalia—tiny stone mortarboards perched on their heads, stone scrolls clutched in their claws. A sign hung between them:

ASHENMOUNT UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGICAL STUDIES
VISITORS PLEASE CHECK IN AT RECEPTION

"It's a university," Bernard said, sounding both relieved and confused.

"Of course it is. Dragons are scholars. Everyone knows that." Wren climbed out of the carriage and straightened her traveling cloak. "Wait here. I shouldn't be long."

"My lady, I really should accompany—"

"If I need someone to stand around looking confused, I'll call you."

She left Bernard sputtering and walked into the cave.

The interior was not what she expected. She had imagined dark tunnels, perhaps some dramatic torchlight, maybe a skeleton or two for atmosphere. Instead, she found herself in a well-lit atrium with polished stone floors and a reception desk staffed by a very small dragon wearing spectacles.

"Can I help you?" the small dragon asked, not looking up from the pile of paperwork in front of him.

"I'm looking for Cornelius of Ashenmount."

"Which one?"

Wren blinked. "There's more than one?"

The small dragon finally looked up. His spectacles magnified his eyes to approximately the size of dinner plates. "There are forty-seven Corneliuses currently enrolled or employed at this institution. It's a very popular name among dragons. Traditional. Dignified. Bit boring, if you ask me, but nobody does." He peered at her. "You're a human."

"Yes."

"We don't get many of those. Are you here for a conference?"

"I'm here because I'm apparently betrothed to one of your Corneliuses. The paperwork says 'Cornelius of Ashenmount Estate.' That's all I have to go on."

The small dragon stared at her for a long moment. Then he burst out laughing.

It was a strange sound, like someone had put gravel in a bellows and was operating it enthusiastically. The dragon laughed so hard that his spectacles fell off and clattered onto the desk.

"Oh, that's WONDERFUL," he wheezed. "Someone finally filed the paperwork against old Cornelius! He's been dodging the Betrothal Office for centuries! I mean, not that I blame him—have you seen the forms? Absolute nightmare. But still!" He wiped a tear from one enormous eye. "Wait until I tell the fellows in the common room."

"I'm glad you find this amusing," Wren said flatly. "Could you perhaps point me toward him?"

"Third floor, east corridor, office at the end. But I should warn you—he's in the middle of his dissertation defense. Very tense. Very intense. Probably don't interrupt if you value your eyebrows."

"My eyebrows?"

"Dragons can get a bit... combustible when stressed."

Wren considered this. Then she shrugged. "I'll risk it."

She found the east corridor easily enough. It was lined with portraits of distinguished-looking dragons, each one labeled with a name, a title, and a list of academic achievements. She passed Cornelius the Wise (Emeritus Professor of Mineral Analysis), Cornelius the Learned (Chair of the Department of Igneous Rock Studies), and Cornelius the Pedantic (who apparently held seventeen degrees and wasn't done yet).

At the end of the corridor, a door stood slightly ajar. From within came the sound of voices—deep, rumbling voices, the kind that made the floor vibrate slightly.

"—and your analysis of the pyroclastic flow patterns is, frankly, UNCONVINCING."

"With respect, Professor Thornscale, I believe my data speaks for itself—"

"Your DATA speaks of INSUFFICIENT FIELD SAMPLES. How many lava tubes did you actually survey?"

"Forty-seven, but—"

"FORTY-SEVEN? In a mountain range containing over THREE HUNDRED documented tubes? You call that comprehensive?"

Wren pushed the door open.

The room was large—it had to be, to accommodate the five dragons currently occupying it. Four of them sat behind a curved table, looking stern and scholarly. The fifth stood at a podium covered in charts and geological diagrams, looking harassed.

All five dragons turned to stare at her.

"Um," Wren said. "Is one of you Cornelius of the Ashenmount Estate?"

The dragon at the podium raised one claw. "That would be me. And you are...?"

"Lady Wren Fitzgerald. Your fiancée, apparently."

The silence that followed was so complete that Wren could hear one of the charts rustling in a draft.

Then Cornelius did something unexpected.

He fainted.

It was really more of a controlled collapse—three tons of dragon crumpling gracefully to the stone floor, charts scattering in all directions, one claw still raised in the air as if he'd been about to make a point.

The four dragons behind the table exchanged looks.

"This is most irregular," said the one who had been complaining about lava tubes. "We're in the middle of a defense."

"My apologies," Wren said, not sounding apologetic at all. "But I believe this takes precedence. We have a clerical situation."

"A clerical situation?"

"I appear to be legally betrothed to your candidate due to a filing error seventeen years ago. We need to resolve this before my eighteenth birthday, which is in three weeks."

One of the other dragons—an elderly female with silver scales and an expression of weary amusement—began to laugh. It was a gentler sound than the receptionist's, more like distant thunder.

"Oh, this is marvelous," she said. "Cornelius has been so smug about avoiding the Betrothal Office. Said they'd never catch up with him. Said his paperwork was impeccable." She looked down at the unconscious dragon with something approaching fondness. "Serves him right."

Cornelius groaned.

"He's waking up," Wren observed. "Perhaps we should give him a moment."

"Perhaps you should give us ALL a moment," the lava-tube dragon grumbled. "We have a dissertation to evaluate."

"Your dissertation can wait," the silver dragon said firmly. "This is far more interesting." She turned to Wren with a smile that showed entirely too many teeth. "I am Professor Emberheart, Dean of Academic Affairs. And I believe, young lady, that you have just made my century considerably more entertaining."

Cornelius sat up slowly. He was, Wren noted, a handsome dragon, if you were the sort of person who found dragons handsome. His scales were a deep copper color, like old pennies, and his eyes—now open and staring at her with a mixture of horror and confusion—were the same green-and-gold as a fire opal.

"This isn't happening," he said.

"I'm afraid it is."

"I filled out exemption forms. I filed deferral requests. I submitted seventeen appeals to the Office's Review Board."

"And yet here I am."

Cornelius put his head in his claws. "My dissertation."

"Will have to wait," Professor Emberheart said cheerfully. "I'm sure the committee can reconvene next month. In the meantime, it seems you have a betrothal to deal with."

"I don't WANT a betrothal. I want to finish my research. I want tenure. I want to spend the next fifty years studying volcanic mineral deposits in PEACE."

"I don't want a betrothal either," Wren said. "I want to catalog beetles. But apparently neither of us gets what we want, because some clerk seventeen years ago couldn't be bothered to read a form properly."

Cornelius looked up at her. For a moment, they just stared at each other—a seventeen-year-old girl who would rather be studying insects, and a four-hundred-year-old dragon who would rather be studying rocks.

"This is absurd," Cornelius said.

"Yes," Wren agreed.

"We need to fix it."

"Obviously."

"There must be a way to dissolve the agreement."

"There is. We need to find someone named Ms. Parchment at the Royal Betrothal Office. She's the only one with the authority to approve a dissolution."

Cornelius brightened slightly. "That doesn't sound too difficult."

"She's on vacation for three weeks."

Cornelius deflated.

"But," Wren continued, "I'm not inclined to wait that long. Are you?"

"Certainly not."

"Then we find her. She's visiting her sister in the Outer Isles. How hard can it be?"

Cornelius stood up, his full height putting him at approximately three times Wren's size. "The Outer Isles are remote, poorly mapped, and plagued by unpredictable weather."

"So?"

"I'm simply pointing out the difficulties."

"Are you a scholar or aren't you? Consider it a field expedition." Wren smiled. "Besides, I hear there are excellent beetles in the Outer Isles. Something about the volcanic soil."

Cornelius stared at her. Then, slowly, something that might have been respect crept into his expression.

"You're not what I expected," he said.

"Neither are you. I expected more fire-breathing and princess-eating."

"That's a vicious stereotype. I'm a vegetarian."

"Noted." Wren held out her hand. "Partners, then? Until this mess is sorted?"

Cornelius looked at her hand, then back at her face. After a moment, he extended one massive claw and very carefully shook it.

"Partners," he agreed. "But I'm bringing my research notes."

"And I'm bringing my specimen jars."

"This," Professor Emberheart said, still watching with evident delight, "is going to be magnificent."
