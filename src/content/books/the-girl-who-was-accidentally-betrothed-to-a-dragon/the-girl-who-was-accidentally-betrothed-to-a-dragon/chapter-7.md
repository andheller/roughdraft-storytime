# The Resolution

Three weeks later, Lady Wren Fitzgerald turned eighteen at a birthday celebration that was, by all accounts, significantly less complicated than anyone had feared.

The great hall of Fitzgerald Manor was decorated with flowers (provided by a new florist shop that had recently opened in the village), and the guest list had been revised to remove any dragons, much to Lady Fitzgerald's relief and Lord Fitzgerald's mild disappointment. (He had secretly been looking forward to meeting a dragon. They seemed interesting.)

Wren stood by the punch bowl, wearing a dress that her mother had insisted upon and that itched in at least fourteen places, watching the various nobles mingle and gossip. She was thinking about beetles.

This was not unusual. Wren was usually thinking about beetles.

"You could at least PRETEND to enjoy your own party," her mother said, appearing at her elbow.

"I'm enjoying it in my own way."

"Your own way involves staring into the middle distance and ignoring the Duke of Pemberton's very eligible son."

"Ah." Wren glanced across the room at the young man in question, who was attempting to look dashing and mostly succeeding. "About that. You should know that the Pemberton family is going through some changes."

"Changes?"

As if on cue, the doors to the great hall opened, and a most unusual party entered.

Sir Galahad Pemberton the Third came first—except he was no longer Sir Galahad. He was wearing simple clothes instead of armor, his hair was free of helmet-dent, and he was carrying an enormous bouquet of flowers that he had apparently grown himself.

Behind him came Cornelius the dragon, who had to duck significantly to fit through the doorway and who was wearing, for reasons known only to himself, a small academic cap perched between his horns.

And behind THEM came Ms. Parchment, clutching a folder of paperwork and looking like she was already mentally cataloging everything wrong with the hall's organizational structure.

The room went very quiet.

"Lady Wren," Sir Galahad announced, striding forward with a confidence he had never possessed as a knight. "I come bearing flowers, as thanks for helping me find my true calling."

He presented the bouquet with a flourish. It was beautiful—roses and lilies and something purple that Wren didn't recognize.

"You're a florist now," she said.

"Officially, as of this morning. Ms. Parchment found the loophole." He beamed. "The Pemberton Knight Exemption Clause of 1672, subsection 14, paragraph 3. If a Pemberton knight can demonstrate 'irreconcilable incompatibility with martial pursuits,' they can petition for release from family obligation. I submitted three years of evidence proving I'm absolutely terrible at being a knight."

"That must have been quite a lot of evidence."

"Seventeen pages. Single-spaced."

Lady Fitzgerald looked like she might faint. "There's a dragon in my great hall."

"Yes, I apologize for that." Cornelius dipped his great head politely. "I'm only here briefly. I wanted to deliver this." He extended one claw, in which he carefully held a small box.

Wren took it and opened it. Inside, nestled in velvet, was a beetle. Not a mounted specimen—a living one, with iridescent green wings that caught the light.

"It's a volcanic emerald beetle," Cornelius explained. "They're only found in the hot springs of the Ashenmount Mountains. Very rare. Very beautiful. I thought, given our unusual acquaintance, you might appreciate it for your collection."

"It's incredible," Wren breathed. She could feel the tiny creature moving against her palm, warm and alive.

"Consider it a birthday gift. And also an apology for the whole betrothal confusion. That wasn't my fault, but I'm sorry nonetheless."

"Thank you." Wren looked up at him. "What about your dissertation?"

"Defended it last week. Passed with distinction." His dragon smile was surprisingly warm. "Professor Emberheart said it was the most interesting defense she'd witnessed in two centuries. Apparently, having to postpone due to an accidental betrothal made for an excellent opening anecdote."

Ms. Parchment stepped forward, clearing her throat. "If I might interrupt the sentimentality, I have paperwork to finalize." She produced a form from her folder. "This is the official Certificate of Betrothal Dissolution, confirming that Lady Wren Fitzgerald is no longer legally betrothed to anyone—dragon, prince, or otherwise. I need a signature here, here, and initials here."

Wren signed. It felt, somehow, momentous—the end of a chapter that should never have been written in the first place.

"Additionally," Ms. Parchment continued, "I'm pleased to inform you that the Royal Betrothal Office is implementing new policies as a result of this case. All future betrothals will require species verification, full legal name documentation, and at least THREE forms of identification." She looked almost satisfied. "It's the most significant reform in two hundred years."

"You must be thrilled," Wren said.

"I am professionally fulfilled. Thrilled is for people who don't understand the gravity of proper documentation."

Lord Fitzgerald, who had been quietly watching all of this with an expression of bemused fascination, finally spoke up. "I don't suppose, Dr. Cornelius, that you'd stay for the party? I've always wanted to speak with a dragon about... well, anything, really."

Cornelius considered this. "I would need a larger chair."

"We have large chairs."

"And perhaps some rocks to eat. I'm fond of granite."

"We have granite in the garden. Decorative, but I'm sure it would be fine."

Lady Fitzgerald made a small noise of distress. Her husband ignored it.

"Then I would be honored," Cornelius said. "I've never attended a human birthday celebration before."

"It's mostly standing around eating small foods and making conversation about nothing important," Wren told him.

"That sounds exactly like academic conferences. I'll feel right at home."

The party resumed, though it was significantly stranger than any party the Fitzgeralds had ever hosted. Cornelius proved surprisingly adept at small talk, especially with Lord Fitzgerald, who turned out to have a passionate interest in geology that he'd never been able to discuss with anyone. Sir Galahad—now just Galahad—spent the evening describing his plans for his flower shop to anyone who would listen, and found more enthusiasm than he had expected. Even Ms. Parchment relaxed enough to accept a cup of tea, though she spent most of the evening reorganizing the library's filing system because she "couldn't bear to look at it."

As the evening wore on, Wren slipped out to the balcony for some fresh air. The moon was full, the garden was quiet, and the volcanic emerald beetle was safely in her pocket, wrapped in a handkerchief.

She heard footsteps behind her and turned to find her mother standing there, looking uncertain.

"I owe you an apology," Lady Fitzgerald said stiffly. Apologies did not come naturally to her. "When I sent that knight after you—"

"The knight worked out fine. He's a florist now."

"Yes, I noticed." Lady Fitzgerald was quiet for a moment. "When I learned you were betrothed to a dragon, I panicked. All I could think about was the scandal, the gossip, what people would say. I didn't stop to consider that you might actually... handle it."

"I handled it."

"You did. Rather impressively." Her mother's expression softened, just slightly. "You found a bureaucrat. You navigated an ancient loophole. You solved a seventeen-year-old clerical error. All while collecting beetles, apparently."

"I'm good at solving problems. When people let me."

Lady Fitzgerald nodded slowly. "I'm beginning to understand that." She reached out and, awkwardly, patted Wren's shoulder. "Happy birthday, Wren. I'm... proud of you."

"Thank you, Mother."

Her mother went back inside. Wren stayed on the balcony, looking at the stars.

She was eighteen now. Officially an adult. Free from accidental betrothals and well-meaning interference. She could do anything she wanted.

What she wanted, she realized, was to write a letter.

*Dear Prince Cornelius,*

*You were right about the volcanic species. The thermal tolerance adaptations are fascinating. I've been reading your paper on heat-resistant chitin, and I have questions. Many questions.*

*Also, I have a new specimen. A volcanic emerald beetle, given to me by a dragon. I thought you might like to know it exists.*

*I'm considering an expedition to the Southern Continent next year. I've heard there are beetles there that no one has properly cataloged. If you're interested in joining, I would welcome the company.*

*No betrothals required.*

*Your colleague in entomology,*
*Lady Wren Fitzgerald*

*P.S. - I've enclosed a sketch of the beetle. Notice the wing structure. It's unlike anything I've ever seen.*

She finished the letter late that night, after the guests had gone and the great hall was quiet. She sealed it with wax and addressed it to the Ashenmount Royal Estate.

In the morning, she sent it by courier.

Two days later, she received a reply.

*Dear Lady Wren,*

*I would be absolutely delighted to join your expedition. I've been looking for an excuse to visit the Southern Continent for years. My parents will disapprove, which makes it even more appealing.*

*Your sketch is excellent. The wing structure suggests a previously unknown subspecies. We should discuss naming rights.*

*I also have questions about your questions. Perhaps we should correspond more frequently.*

*Perhaps we should correspond quite a lot.*

*Your colleague in entomology (and adventures),*
*Prince Cornelius Ashworth*

*P.S. - The dragon stopped by yesterday. He wanted to tell me about a new mineral deposit he discovered. I think he was also checking up on me. Apparently, he feels responsible for our acquaintance.*

*P.P.S. - He brought me a rock. I'm not sure what to do with it, but it was kind of him.*

Wren read the letter three times. Then she smiled, tucked it into her specimen journal, and began planning an expedition.

She was eighteen years old. She was officially un-betrothed. She had friends—a dragon, a former knight, and a prince who understood beetles.

And somewhere out there, in the vast bureaucratic wilderness of the Royal Betrothal Office, her file had been permanently closed, stamped with the words: CASE RESOLVED - THE CORNELIUS AMBIGUITY.

It was, all things considered, a very good start.

THE END
