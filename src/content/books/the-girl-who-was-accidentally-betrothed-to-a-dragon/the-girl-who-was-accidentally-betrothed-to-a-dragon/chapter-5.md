# The Forms

They returned to Ms. Parchment's cottage the next morning to find the door open and the entire front room transformed into what could only be described as a war room for paperwork.

Files were everywhere. Stacked on tables, spread across the floor, pinned to the walls. Red string connected various documents in ways that seemed meaningful only to Ms. Parchment, who stood in the center of it all like a general surveying her battlefield.

"Come in," she said without turning around. "Watch your step. Don't touch anything. And for the love of proper filing, don't BREATHE on the 1847 documents—they're extremely fragile."

Wren carefully navigated around a pile of yellowed papers. "You've been busy."

"I haven't slept. I had a dolphin bring me files from the Office's auxiliary storage facility." Ms. Parchment turned to face them, and Wren saw that her eyes were slightly manic behind her spectacles. "Do you know what I found?"

"Something good?" Sir Galahad asked hopefully.

"Something FASCINATING." Ms. Parchment grabbed a document from the nearest pile and thrust it at Wren. "This is the original betrothal filing. Look at it. LOOK at it carefully."

Wren looked. It was a standard form—boxes and lines and official stamps—but the handwriting was almost illegible. "I can barely read this."

"That's because Marmaduke Pennywhistle the Younger had terrible penmanship. But look HERE." Ms. Parchment pointed at a specific box. "The betrothed party field. What does it say?"

Wren squinted. "'Cornelius of Ashenmount Estate.' That's what we already knew."

"Yes, but look at what it DOESN'T say." Ms. Parchment's smile was almost feral. "There's no species designation. No title. No identifying numbers. Just 'Cornelius of Ashenmount Estate.'"

"So?"

"SO, young lady, this creates what we in the bureaucracy call a 'fatal ambiguity.'" Ms. Parchment began pacing, stepping over files with the ease of long practice. "The form ASSUMES that the betrothed party is clearly identified. But 'Cornelius of Ashenmount' is not a clear identification. It's practically MEANINGLESS."

Cornelius raised a claw. "I beg your pardon. I'm Cornelius of Ashenmount."

"Yes, YOU are. But you're not the only one."

"Well, yes, there are forty-seven Corneliuses at the university—"

"I'm not talking about the university." Ms. Parchment grabbed another document. "I'm talking about THIS."

It was a birth certificate, old but well-preserved. At the top, in elegant calligraphy, it read:

PRINCE CORNELIUS MARCUS ASHWORTH
Born: Ashenmount Royal Estate
Title: Third in Line to the Throne of Ashenmount

Wren stared at it. "There's a HUMAN prince named Cornelius? From the Ashenmount Estate?"

"The Ashenmount Royal Estate is different from the Ashenmount Dragon Territory, but they share a name. A very old name. Goes back centuries. And seventeen years ago, when your betrothal was filed, there was indeed a human baby named Cornelius associated with Ashenmount."

"So the clerk might have meant—"

"The clerk didn't specify WHICH Cornelius. The form just says 'Cornelius of Ashenmount Estate.' That could refer to the dragon Cornelius OR the human prince Cornelius. The paperwork doesn't clarify."

Cornelius sat down heavily, which caused several stacks of paper to flutter. "Are you saying this entire situation is because of a NAMING coincidence?"

"I'm saying it's because of inadequate documentation practices. But yes, essentially." Ms. Parchment looked almost gleeful. "Form 17-X, the Ambiguity Clause, allows for the reinterpretation of betrothal agreements when the original filing contains a fatal ambiguity. If we can prove that 'Cornelius of Ashenmount' could reasonably refer to EITHER party, we can petition to have the betrothal reassigned."

"Reassigned to the prince," Wren said slowly. "The human prince."

"Exactly."

"But wait." Sir Galahad was frowning. "Wouldn't that just create a NEW problem? Now Lady Wren would be betrothed to some prince she's never met."

"A human prince," Ms. Parchment said. "Which is what her parents presumably wanted in the first place. A traditional match. Nothing unusual. Nothing requiring special cross-species documentation."

"But I don't WANT to be betrothed to anyone," Wren protested. "That's the whole point!"

"Patience." Ms. Parchment held up another form. "This is where it gets interesting. Prince Cornelius Ashworth is eighteen years old. He reached the age of majority three months ago. According to Betrothal Law, once a party reaches majority, they can formally contest any pre-arranged betrothal by filing a Form 88-C, the 'Mutual Dissolution by Consent of Both Parties.'"

"So if the betrothal is transferred to the prince—"

"And the prince agrees to dissolve it—"

"Then it's over? Just like that?"

"Just like that. Assuming, of course, that the prince cooperates." Ms. Parchment's expression sobered slightly. "I don't know Prince Cornelius personally. He might be delighted to dissolve a surprise betrothal. Or he might be... less cooperative."

Wren thought about this. "What do we know about him?"

"Not much. The Ashworth royal family is relatively private. They control the Ashenmount region—the human parts, anyway. Moderate kingdom. Nothing particularly notable." Ms. Parchment shuffled through some papers. "There ARE a few social notices. Apparently the prince is known for... ah."

"For what?"

"For his interest in natural history."

"Natural history?"

"Specifically entomology."

"Specifically WHAT?"

"Bugs, dear." Ms. Parchment looked up with an expression that was almost amused. "Prince Cornelius Ashworth is apparently quite passionate about bugs. Beetles in particular."

The silence that followed was profound.

"He collects beetles," Wren said.

"According to the society pages, yes. Caused quite a scandal when he skipped a royal ball to attend a lecture on dung beetles."

Cornelius made a sound that might have been a laugh. "Well, well."

"This doesn't change anything," Wren said quickly. "I'm not interested in being betrothed to ANYONE, beetle collector or otherwise."

"No, but it does suggest he might be sympathetic to your situation." Ms. Parchment began gathering documents into a neat stack. "Someone who prefers bugs to balls might understand someone who prefers beetles to betrothals."

"So what's the plan?" Sir Galahad asked. "We go find the prince?"

"You go find the prince," Ms. Parchment confirmed. "You explain the situation. You get him to sign the Form 88-C. You bring it back to me, I file it, and this whole mess becomes a footnote in the Office's records." She paused. "Well, a very LONG footnote. With multiple appendices. And probably its own filing cabinet."

"Where is Prince Cornelius now?"

"The Ashenmount Royal Estate. About two days' travel from here, if you have a dragon." She gave Cornelius a meaningful look. "You DO have a dragon."

"I'm not a mode of transportation," Cornelius grumbled. "I'm a scholar."

"You're both. Most things in life are multiple things." Ms. Parchment handed Wren the stack of documents. "Take these. You'll need them for the formal petition. Form 17-X, Form 88-C, copies of the original filing, the birth certificate, and my preliminary assessment. All properly notarized."

"You notarized them already?"

"I notarized them SEVENTEEN years ago. I told you, I knew about this case. I've been waiting for someone to actually DO something about it." She allowed herself a small smile. "I'm glad someone finally did."

Wren tucked the documents carefully into her specimen bag (which was surprisingly waterproof and organizationally sound). "Thank you, Ms. Parchment. Truly."

"Don't thank me yet. The paperwork is only half the battle. You still need to convince a prince to give up a perfectly good betrothal."

"It's not a perfectly good betrothal. It's a clerical error."

"To you, it's an error. To someone else, it might be an opportunity." Ms. Parchment's expression was unreadable. "Princes have been known to enjoy advantageous marriages. Even accidental ones."

"But you said he was interested in beetles—"

"Interest in beetles does not preclude interest in politics. Just... be careful. Princes are unpredictable. Especially young ones."

Sir Galahad raised his hand. "What about my situation? The knight thing?"

Ms. Parchment sighed. "One bureaucratic nightmare at a time, Sir Pemberton. Resolve the betrothal, then come back. I'll need to review three hundred years of Knight's Guild regulations to find a loophole for you."

"You'd do that?"

"I'd do it because it would be INTERESTING. The Pemberton exemption clause has never been successfully invoked. It would be a professional challenge." She almost smiled. "I do enjoy a professional challenge."

They said their goodbyes and left the cottage, documents in hand, destination clear.

"Two days to the Ashenmount Royal Estate," Wren said, looking at the sky. "We should start now."

"Agreed." Cornelius stretched his wings. "Though I have to say, the irony of this situation is not lost on me."

"What irony?"

"I've spent four hundred years avoiding betrothals, and now my freedom depends on me helping to arrange one." He shook his great copper head. "The universe has a strange sense of humor."

"At least you're not the one getting betrothed this time."

"True. That IS a significant improvement."

Sir Galahad climbed carefully onto Cornelius's back, settling behind Wren. "To the prince, then?"

"To the prince." Wren patted her specimen bag, feeling the reassuring weight of the documents inside. "And hopefully, to the end of this ridiculous mess."

Cornelius launched into the sky, leaving the bird-covered island behind. Below them, in her meticulously organized cottage, Ms. Parchment was already starting a new file.

She labeled it: THE CORNELIUS AMBIGUITY.

It was going to be magnificent.
