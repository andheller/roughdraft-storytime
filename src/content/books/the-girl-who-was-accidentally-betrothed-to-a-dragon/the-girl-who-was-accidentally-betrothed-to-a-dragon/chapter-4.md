# The Bureaucrat's Quest

The Outer Isles were, as Cornelius had warned, poorly mapped. This was putting it generously. The map they had obtained from a fisherman on the coast contained approximately four islands, a sea serpent (labeled "Here Be Stanley"), and the encouraging note "Probably More Islands Around Here Somewhere."

"This is useless," Sir Galahad said, peering at it.

"It's not useless. It's... interpretive." Wren turned the map sideways. "I think this squiggle might be Ms. Parchment's sister's island. Or possibly a coffee stain."

They were standing on the deck of a ferry that serviced the outer islands, or at least the ones that the ferry captain remembered existed. The captain herself was a weathered woman named Captain Marlowe who had been sailing these waters for forty years and still managed to get lost on a weekly basis.

"You want the Parchment cottage?" Captain Marlowe had said when they boarded. "Oh, that's on Gull Island. Or was it Tern Island? Something with birds. Lots of bird islands out there. Very popular with birds, the Outer Isles."

"Do you know which bird, specifically?" Wren had asked.

"Definitely a seabird. Probably."

This was the level of precision they were working with.

Cornelius was not on the ferry. He was flying alongside it, keeping a respectful distance so as not to alarm the other passengers (of which there were three: an old man who was asleep, a woman with a basket of fish, and a goat, which was technically cargo but had refused to go below deck).

"Tell me more about Ms. Parchment," Sir Galahad said, still studying the map as if it might suddenly become helpful. "What's she like?"

"I've never met her. I only know she's the Senior Clerk at the Royal Betrothal Office, and she's the only one authorized to approve dissolutions." Wren watched a seagull fight another seagull for a scrap of bread. The seagulls in the Outer Isles were particularly aggressive. "The lawyers said she was 'very particular about forms.'"

"What does that mean?"

"Probably that she likes things done properly."

"I like things done properly," Sir Galahad said earnestly. "I always polish my armor before a quest. And I organize my swords by length."

"How many swords do you have?"

"Twelve. It's a family tradition. One for each maiden Sir Galahad the First rescued."

"That's a lot of swords for someone who doesn't like fighting."

Sir Galahad looked uncomfortable. "I mostly just... dust them."

The ferry lurched suddenly, and Captain Marlowe's voice rang out: "Found it! Definitely bird island! See all the birds?"

There were, indeed, a lot of birds. The island rising from the mist ahead was absolutely covered in them—gulls and terns and puffins and several species Wren couldn't identify. The air was thick with cries and calls and the general chaos of avian society.

"That's a lot of birds," Sir Galahad said faintly.

"This doesn't narrow it down," Wren muttered. "EVERY island here probably has birds."

But as the ferry drew closer, she spotted something promising: a small cottage perched on a cliff, with a neat garden and a sign by the door. Even from this distance, she could see that the sign was organized, labeled, and extremely official-looking.

"That's the place," she said with certainty. "Nobody else would have a sign that bureaucratic."

They disembarked on a small dock that swayed alarmingly under their feet. Cornelius landed nearby, scattering birds in all directions and earning a reproachful look from the woman with the fish basket.

"Sorry," he said. "I tried to be quiet."

The path to the cottage wound up through the bird-covered rocks. It was paved with precisely cut stones, each one level with the next. The garden they passed was organized by color AND by species AND by height, with small labels at the base of each plant indicating its Latin name and optimal watering schedule.

"This woman is very organized," Sir Galahad observed.

"This woman is TERRIFYINGLY organized," Cornelius corrected. "I respect it."

The door of the cottage opened before they could knock, and a woman appeared. She was small, gray-haired, and wearing spectacles that magnified her eyes to an unsettling degree. She looked at them—the teenage girl, the knight with socks stuffed in his boots, and the three-ton dragon—with an expression of profound resignation.

"You're from the Office, aren't you," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Not exactly," Wren began.

"It's ALWAYS the Office. I take ONE vacation in fifteen years, and somehow the Office finds me. Do you know how far the Outer Isles are? Do you know how hard it was to get here? I had to take THREE ferries and a fishing boat and at one point I rode a dolphin, and STILL the Office finds me."

"We're not from the Office, exactly," Wren tried again. "We're... clients. With a problem."

"Everyone has a problem. That's why I went on vacation. To GET AWAY from the problems." Ms. Parchment folded her arms. "Whatever it is, it can wait until I'm back in the capital. I have a schedule. The schedule says I'm on holiday for three more weeks. The schedule does not say 'entertain random visitors with problems.'"

"Please," Wren said. "It's urgent. I'm betrothed to a dragon by mistake, and I need—"

"Betrothed to a—" Ms. Parchment's eyes went wide behind her spectacles. "The Fitzgerald girl? THAT case?"

"You know about it?"

"Of COURSE I know about it. I'm the Senior Clerk. I know about EVERYTHING. The Fitzgerald case has been sitting in my 'urgent' pile for seventeen years." She paused. "Which, now that I say it out loud, doesn't sound very urgent. But bureaucracy moves slowly. These things take time."

"Seventeen years is a lot of time," Cornelius pointed out.

"You're the dragon." Ms. Parchment studied him with professional interest. "Cornelius of Ashenmount. Dissertation on volcanic minerals. Applied for seventeen extensions to your betrothal review. All denied."

"I was hoping you hadn't received those."

"I receive EVERYTHING." She turned back to Wren. "And you. Lady Wren Fitzgerald. Seventeen years old. Ranked fourteenth in eligibility. Known for"—she paused, consulting some mental file—"correcting people about beetles at parties."

"I've gotten better about that."

"Hmm." Ms. Parchment looked between them. Then she looked at Sir Galahad, who was trying very hard to be invisible. "And who's this? Another betrothal problem?"

"Career dissolution, actually," Sir Galahad said quietly. "I'd like to stop being a knight."

"Pemberton family?"

"Yes."

"Third generation?"

"Seventh, technically."

Ms. Parchment made a sound that might have been a laugh. "The Pembertons. Always with the knights. Your great-great-grandfather submitted a resignation request once, you know. Said he wanted to become a candlestick maker. His family had him committed." She shook her head. "The paperwork for THAT was a nightmare."

"Is there any way you could help us?" Wren asked. "I know you're on holiday, but—"

"On holiday. Yes. AWAY from the Office. AWAY from the paperwork. AWAY from the seventeen piles of urgent cases that have been sitting on my desk for decades because the junior clerks can't find the right forms." Ms. Parchment's eye twitched. "Do you have any idea how many forms there are in the Royal Betrothal Office? Four thousand, two hundred, and seventy-three. And that's not counting the subsections. Or the amendments. Or the special appendices for cases involving non-human parties."

"That... does sound like a lot," Wren admitted.

"It IS a lot. And I've memorized them all. Every single one. Form 27-B for standard dissolutions. Form 114-J for cross-species betrothals. Form 892-M for retroactive nullification of clerical errors. Form 17-X for—" She stopped. Blinked. "Wait."

"What?"

"Form 17-X." Ms. Parchment's expression changed. "The Ambiguity Clause. I haven't thought about that one in years."

"What's Form 17-X?" Cornelius asked.

"It's... obscure. Very old. Rarely used. But it might..." She trailed off, staring into the middle distance. "The original betrothal document. Do you have a copy?"

"No, but the Office should have the original."

"Hmm." Ms. Parchment was quiet for a long moment. The birds screamed around them. The wind ruffled her organized garden. Finally, she sighed.

"Come inside," she said. "I need to review some things. And I suppose you'd all like tea."

"You're going to help us?" Wren asked, hardly daring to believe it.

"I'm going to LOOK at the case. That's not the same as helping." Ms. Parchment turned back toward her cottage. "But I admit, the Ambiguity Clause possibility is... intriguing. I do love a good bureaucratic loophole."

"She loves loopholes," Sir Galahad whispered to Wren. "That seems like a good sign."

"She also called my father's resignation request a 'nightmare,'" Wren whispered back. "So let's not get too excited."

They followed Ms. Parchment into the cottage, which was exactly as organized as Wren had expected. Every book was alphabetized. Every tea cup was labeled. Every chair had a small sign indicating its optimal weight capacity.

"Sit," Ms. Parchment commanded. "And tell me everything. From the beginning. And for the love of proper documentation, don't skip any details."

So Wren told her everything. The birthday invitations. The lawyers. The journey to Ashenmount. The fainting dragon. The knight with flowers in his heart. All of it.

When she finished, Ms. Parchment was silent for a very long time.

"Form 17-X," she said finally. "Yes. That might actually work."

"What does it do?" Cornelius asked.

Ms. Parchment smiled. It was a small smile, barely there, but it was the first one they'd seen from her.

"Come back tomorrow," she said. "I need to send for some files. And then, I think, we're going to have a very interesting conversation about the name 'Cornelius.'"

"The name?"

"Just come back tomorrow. And bring documentation. ALL of it."

She showed them to the door and closed it firmly behind them.

Outside, the birds continued their endless screaming. The wind continued to blow. And somewhere, in a pile of paperwork that had been sitting untouched for seventeen years, an answer was waiting to be found.

"Well," said Sir Galahad. "That went better than I expected."

"Did it?" Wren asked.

"Nobody tried to set anyone on fire. I count that as a win."

Cornelius snorted, releasing a small puff of smoke. "The day is young."
