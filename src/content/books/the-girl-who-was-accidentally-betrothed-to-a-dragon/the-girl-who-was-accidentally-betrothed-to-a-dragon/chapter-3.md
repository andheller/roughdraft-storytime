# The Knight Arrives

They were three hours into their journey to the Outer Isles when the knight appeared.

Wren had been riding on Cornelius's back, which was considerably faster than the carriage (Bernard had been sent home with a note for her parents, which simply read: "Fixing the problem. Back soon. Don't worry. - W"). The view from dragon-height was spectacular, and Wren had already spotted seventeen species of birds she'd never seen before. She was making notes in her field journal when she heard the horn.

"What's that?" she asked.

Cornelius sighed. It was a massive exhalation that briefly warmed the air around them by several degrees. "That," he said, "would be trouble."

Below them, a figure on horseback was galloping along the road, blowing a horn with one hand and waving a sword with the other. He wore armor that gleamed in the sunlight and a helmet topped with an elaborate plume of feathers. He was also, Wren noticed, heading directly toward them.

"HALT, FOUL BEAST!" the knight shouted. "RELEASE THE MAIDEN!"

"Oh, for the love of sedimentary rock," Cornelius muttered.

"Should we... stop?"

"If we don't, he'll just keep following us. They always do." Cornelius began to descend, landing with surprising grace in a meadow beside the road. "Fair warning: this might take a while."

The knight thundered up, his horse wheezing with exertion. He was, Wren observed, young—probably only a few years older than her—and extremely enthusiastic. His armor had been polished so aggressively that it was almost blinding.

"STAND ASIDE, MONSTER!" he bellowed, pointing his sword at Cornelius. "I, Sir Galahad Pemberton the Third, have come to rescue this fair maiden from your villainous clutches!"

"I'm not clutching her," Cornelius said patiently. "She's sitting on my back. There's a difference."

"You have KIDNAPPED her!"

"I really haven't."

"I have DOCUMENTATION!" Sir Galahad produced a scroll from somewhere in his armor and unfurled it dramatically. "A formal complaint was filed with the Royal Knight's Guild! A damsel in distress! Abducted by a dragon! This is EXACTLY the sort of situation I am trained for!"

Wren raised her hand. "Excuse me?"

Sir Galahad faltered slightly. "Yes?"

"I'm not in distress. And I haven't been abducted. We're traveling together voluntarily."

"But... but the documentation says..."

"Let me see that." Wren slid off Cornelius's back and walked over to the knight. She took the scroll from his unresisting fingers and read it.

OFFICIAL RESCUE REQUEST
Filed by: Lady Fitzgerald (mother)
Nature of Emergency: Daughter has been TAKEN by a DRAGON
Damsel Status: Very distressed (presumably)
Dragon Status: Evil (presumably)
Urgency Level: MAXIMUM

"My mother filed this," Wren said flatly.

"Your mother cares about your safety!"

"My mother cares about my birthday party not being ruined by a scandal." Wren handed the scroll back. "There's been a misunderstanding. Cornelius and I are partners in a bureaucratic matter. We're going to find a clerk. There's no distress. There's no kidnapping. There's no need for a rescue."

Sir Galahad looked stricken. "But... I rode all the way from the capital."

"I'm sorry about that."

"I polished my armor for THREE HOURS."

"It's very shiny," Wren acknowledged.

"I wrote a speech." He patted a pocket in his armor sadly. "It was quite good. There was a bit about honor, and a bit about valor, and a part where I compared you to a rose among thorns."

"That sounds... nice."

"It RHYMED."

Wren felt, unexpectedly, a little sorry for him. He looked so deflated, sitting there on his exhausted horse with his polished armor and his useless speech. "Look, Sir—what was it?"

"Galahad. Sir Galahad Pemberton the Third."

"Right. Sir Galahad. I appreciate the effort, truly. But I don't need rescuing. What I need is to find a bureaucrat."

Sir Galahad's brow furrowed beneath his visor. "A bureaucrat?"

"Her name is Ms. Parchment. She works at the Royal Betrothal Office. She's currently on holiday in the Outer Isles, and we need to find her so she can dissolve an erroneous betrothal agreement."

"The betrothal is between her and me," Cornelius added. "Which neither of us wants. So we're trying to fix it."

"You're betrothed? To HIM?"

"Clerical error," Wren said. "Long story."

Sir Galahad sat in silence for a moment, processing this information. Then, slowly, his expression brightened.

"So the dragon ISN'T villainous?"

"He's a geology scholar. He's writing a dissertation on volcanic mineral deposits."

"And you AREN'T being held against your will?"

"I'm searching for beetles. Voluntarily."

"And the whole situation is just... paperwork?"

"Essentially."

Sir Galahad removed his helmet, revealing a face that was younger than Wren had expected—freckled and earnest and currently working through some complicated emotions. "This is... this is not at all what I was trained for."

"What WERE you trained for?" Cornelius asked, with what might have been genuine curiosity.

"Dragons. Evil ones. Who kidnap maidens. Who need to be defeated in single combat." He gestured vaguely with his sword. "There's usually a battle. Sometimes fire. Always a grateful damsel who needs escorting home."

"That sounds exhausting," Wren said.

"It IS exhausting. And terrifying. And honestly, I'm not very good at it." Sir Galahad slumped in his saddle. "I've been a knight for two years and I haven't rescued anyone. This was supposed to be my first real quest. My father was a knight. And his father. And HIS father. All the way back to the original Sir Galahad Pemberton, who rescued TWELVE maidens in a single afternoon."

"That seems like a lot of maidens," Cornelius observed.

"It was a very busy afternoon. Apparently there was a discount on kidnappings that week."

Wren and Cornelius exchanged looks.

"Sir Galahad," Wren said slowly. "What would you rather be doing? If you weren't a knight?"

The question seemed to catch him off guard. "What do you mean?"

"I mean, if you could do anything. If your father and grandfather and great-great-great-grandfather weren't all watching. What would you choose?"

Sir Galahad was quiet for a long moment. Then, very softly, he said: "Flowers."

"I'm sorry?"

"I'd grow flowers. I'd have a little shop somewhere quiet, where nobody was trying to kill me or set me on fire or write songs about my heroic deeds. I'd have window boxes with petunias. I'd learn which soils work best for roses. I'd..." He trailed off, looking embarrassed. "It's stupid."

"It's not stupid," Wren said. "It's what you want."

"Wants don't matter. Not for Pembertons. We're knights. We've ALWAYS been knights. The armor has been in my family for seven generations." He gestured at himself. "It doesn't even fit properly. I have to stuff socks in the boots."

Cornelius cleared his throat. "I couldn't help but notice that you seem reluctant to actually fight me."

"What?"

"When you rode up, you waved your sword around, but you never actually... attacked. You just sort of pointed at things and shouted."

Sir Galahad's face went red. "I was... working up to it."

"Were you?"

"The shouting is an important part. You have to establish dominance."

"You were stalling."

"I was NOT stalling, I was—" He stopped. His shoulders dropped. "I was absolutely stalling. I'm terrified of dragons. I'm terrified of combat. I'm terrified of HORSES, frankly, and I've been riding one for two years. I'm the worst knight in the history of the Pemberton family, and that includes Great-Uncle Reginald, who once challenged a windmill to a duel and LOST."

"Then why do you keep doing it?" Wren asked.

"Because I don't know how to stop! The Guild has expectations! My family has expectations! There are QUOTAS, do you know that? Every knight is supposed to complete at least three rescues a year. I've done NONE. They're going to revoke my certification!"

Wren looked at Cornelius. Cornelius looked at Wren.

"Sir Galahad," Wren said. "What if I told you there might be a way to get out of the knight business? Legally and officially, with proper paperwork?"

His eyes widened. "Is that possible?"

"It might be. The woman we're looking for, Ms. Parchment, handles all sorts of official dissolutions. Betrothals, contracts, professional certifications..." She glanced at Cornelius. "Maybe even knight registrations?"

"The Outer Isles," Cornelius mused. "Known for their flowers."

"Excellent volcanic soil," Wren added. "Very good for petunias."

Sir Galahad looked between them, hope dawning on his face like a very confused sunrise. "You think... you think she could help me?"

"I think it's worth asking." Wren climbed back onto Cornelius's back. "What do you say? Want to join a quest to find a bureaucrat?"

Sir Galahad straightened in his saddle. For a moment, he looked almost like a real knight—determined, courageous, ready for adventure. Then he sneezed, because he was allergic to his own horse, and the moment was somewhat ruined.

"Yes," he said, wiping his nose. "Yes, I would like that very much."

"Then let's go." Wren looked down at his exhausted horse. "Can that animal keep up with a dragon?"

"Probably not."

"He can ride with us," Cornelius offered, somewhat grudgingly. "If he promises not to point any swords at me."

Sir Galahad sheathed his sword immediately. "Done."

"And if he stops calling me 'foul beast.'"

"Also done. What should I call you?"

"Cornelius. I have a doctorate."

"Dr. Cornelius it is."

And so their party grew to three: a girl who loved beetles, a dragon who loved rocks, and a knight who secretly loved flowers. They made an unlikely team. They made an even more unlikely rescue squad.

But then again, nobody was being rescued.

Not yet, anyway.
