# The Other Cornelius

The Ashenmount Royal Estate was not what Wren expected.

She had imagined something grand—towering spires, fluttering banners, guards in polished armor standing at attention. The usual royal nonsense. What she found instead was a sprawling manor house surrounded by gardens and greenhouses, with not a single banner in sight.

"Are you sure this is the place?" Sir Galahad asked, squinting at the building.

"The sign says 'Ashenmount Royal Estate,'" Cornelius observed. "I would assume that's fairly conclusive."

The sign in question was small and tasteful, almost apologetic about announcing royalty. Next to it was a larger, more enthusiastic sign that read: ASHENMOUNT ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY - VISITORS WELCOME.

"I think I like this prince already," Wren murmured.

They landed in what appeared to be a designated dragon landing zone (helpfully labeled as such), and were immediately greeted by a butler who showed no surprise whatsoever at their unusual party.

"Lady Wren Fitzgerald?" the butler inquired. "His Highness is expecting you."

"Expecting us?"

"Word travels quickly. Ms. Parchment sent a courier dolphin. Very efficient creatures, dolphins." The butler gestured toward the manor. "If you'll follow me? His Highness is in the east greenhouse. Something about a rare weevil delivery."

They followed the butler through the manor, which was decorated with an eclectic mix of royal portraits and mounted insects. A particularly impressive beetle specimen hung above the main staircase, framed in gold.

"Is that a *Dynastes hercules*?" Wren asked, stopping to stare.

"Yes, my lady. His Highness caught it himself during an expedition to the Southern Continent. It remains one of his prized possessions."

"It's beautiful."

"He'll be pleased you think so. Most visitors just ask why there's a giant bug on the wall."

The east greenhouse was warm and humid, filled with tropical plants and the gentle sound of insects buzzing. In the center of it all, a young man with dark hair and dirt-smudged glasses was carefully transferring small beetles from a shipping container into a terrarium.

"Just a moment," he said without looking up. "These little fellows are stressed from travel. They need gentle handling."

Wren found herself holding her breath as she watched him work. His movements were precise and careful, exactly the way she handled her own specimens. When the last beetle was safely in its new home, he straightened up and turned to face them.

Prince Cornelius Ashworth was, objectively speaking, quite handsome. He had the kind of face that probably looked good on coins—strong jaw, clear eyes, a nose that suggested good breeding. But what Wren noticed most was that his fingernails had dirt under them and his shirt had a small tear at the cuff where something had clearly snagged it.

He looked, in other words, like someone who actually did things.

"Lady Wren Fitzgerald," he said, extending a hand. "I've heard about your collection. The Fitzgerald beetle room is apparently legendary."

"You've heard about my beetles?"

"The entomological community is smaller than you'd think. Word gets around." He smiled, and it was a genuine smile, not the practiced kind that royalty usually deployed. "I understand we're accidentally betrothed?"

"According to the paperwork, yes."

"How wonderfully absurd." He gestured toward a table with chairs. "Sit, please. And perhaps explain how we're going to un-betroth ourselves? The dolphin message was somewhat vague."

Wren sat and began laying out the documents while Cornelius (the dragon) and Sir Galahad found spots around the periphery. The prince listened attentively as she explained the situation—the clerical error, the two Corneliuses, the Ambiguity Clause, and the mutual dissolution form.

"So you need me to sign this," the prince said, picking up Form 88-C, "and the entire problem goes away."

"Essentially, yes."

"And you came all this way—tracked down a bureaucrat on vacation, deciphered a seventeen-year-old filing error, and convinced a dragon to give you a ride—just to ask me to sign a piece of paper?"

"When you put it that way, it does seem rather simple."

Prince Cornelius laughed. It was a nice laugh, warm and unexpected. "Most people would have just waited for Ms. Parchment to come back from holiday."

"I'm not most people."

"No, you're clearly not." He set down the form and studied her with those clear eyes. "Can I ask you something? Before I sign?"

"Of course."

"Why beetles?"

It was such an unexpected question that Wren actually had to think about it. "What do you mean?"

"I mean, you're nobility. You could do anything. Host parties. Commission portraits. Collect jewelry or horses or whatever it is noble ladies are supposed to collect. But you chose beetles. Why?"

Wren was quiet for a moment. In the background, the beetles in the terrarium made soft rustling sounds.

"Because they're honest," she said finally. "Beetles don't pretend to be anything they're not. They don't play politics or worry about rankings or care if you use the right fork at dinner. A beetle is just... a beetle. You can observe it, document it, understand it. There are rules—scientific rules—and if you follow them, you get truth. I like truth."

Prince Cornelius nodded slowly. "That's almost exactly what I would have said."

"Why beetles for you?"

"Because they're the largest order of insects, representing about forty percent of all known insect species. They're the most successful life form on the planet, and most people barely notice them." He smiled. "I like noticing things that other people overlook."

They sat in silence for a moment, two people who had accidentally discovered they understood each other.

"You know," the prince said, "if we HAD been properly betrothed—intentionally, I mean—this might not have been terrible."

Wren felt her face grow warm. "We've only just met."

"I know. I'm just observing." He picked up a pen. "But I understand you want your freedom. You want to choose your own path. I respect that." He paused. "I want the same thing, honestly. My parents have opinions about who I should marry, and none of their candidates have ever understood why there's a beetle over the main staircase."

"It's a magnificent specimen."

"Thank you. Caught it myself during—"

"An expedition to the Southern Continent. Your butler mentioned."

Prince Cornelius grinned. "You were paying attention."

"I always pay attention to beetles."

He signed the form with a flourish and handed it back to her. "There. Officially un-betrothed. You're free."

Wren looked at the signature, feeling an unexpected mix of relief and something else—something she couldn't quite name. "Thank you."

"Thank YOU. This was the most interesting morning I've had in months." He stood and offered his hand again. "Perhaps we could correspond? Compare notes on our collections? I'm working on a complete survey of Ashenmount's native ground beetles, and I'd love an outside perspective."

"I'd like that." Wren shook his hand, noting again the calluses and dirt. "I'm particularly interested in the volcanic species. The ones that live near the hot springs."

"Oh, those are fascinating! The thermal tolerance adaptations alone—" He caught himself, laughing. "Sorry. I could talk about this for hours."

"So could I."

They looked at each other, and something passed between them—not romance, exactly, but recognition. The look of one dedicated oddball seeing another.

"Your dragon is very patient," the prince observed, glancing at Cornelius (who had fallen asleep on a patch of warm stones near the greenhouse heater).

"He's not MY dragon. We're just... traveling together."

"Still. It's not every day you see a dragon napping in a greenhouse."

Sir Galahad, who had been very quiet throughout this exchange, cleared his throat. "If I might ask, Your Highness—do you know anything about the process for dissolving knight certifications? Hypothetically?"

The prince raised an eyebrow. "Tired of the knight business?"

"Exhausted."

"There's a form for that. Form 445-K, I think. My cousin tried to resign from the Royal Guard once." He paused. "He wasn't successful, but that was because he filled out the wrong form. The bureaucracy can be navigated, if you know how."

"We have a consultant," Wren said. "Ms. Parchment."

"Oh, if you have Ms. Parchment, you're in good hands. She's legendary. They say she once found a loophole that dissolved an entire county. The county didn't technically exist anymore, so no one could be taxed for living there." The prince shrugged. "The county is still there, of course. People still live there. They just don't have to pay taxes."

"That seems... problematic."

"That's bureaucracy for you. The forms create their own reality."

Wren tucked the signed document carefully into her specimen bag. "We should go. Get this back to Ms. Parchment before anything else goes wrong."

"Wise." The prince walked them to the door. "It was genuinely nice to meet you, Lady Wren. And you, Sir Galahad. And..." He glanced at the still-sleeping dragon. "Dr. Cornelius, I presume?"

Cornelius opened one eye. "You know, you could have mentioned earlier that there was another Cornelius of Ashenmount. Would have saved everyone a lot of trouble."

"We dragons don't interact much with the human nobility. And my parents don't exactly advertise our name—too many people asking if we're related to the dragons." The prince smiled. "We're not, for the record. Just unlucky with geography."

"Noted." Cornelius stretched, standing and shaking off his nap. "Ready to go?"

"Ready." Wren paused at the door. "I'll write to you. About the volcanic beetles."

"I look forward to it." Prince Cornelius's smile was warm. "And Lady Wren? For what it's worth—I think you're going to have a wonderful eighteenth birthday. Now that you're not accidentally betrothed to anyone."

"Neither dragon nor prince."

"Neither dragon nor prince," he agreed. "Just yourself. Which seems like more than enough."

They said their goodbyes and lifted off into the afternoon sky, the signed form tucked safely away, the tangled web of paperwork finally beginning to unravel.

Behind them, in his greenhouse, Prince Cornelius Ashworth returned to his beetles with a smile on his face.

He would write to her first, he decided. No sense waiting.

After all, good beetle correspondents were hard to find.
