# Learning the Sweeps

The first morning, Samuel woke to the sound of men's voices and the smell of coffee.

He sat up in the dark of the wigwam. The other bedrolls were empty. Gray light showed through the canvas flap. He pulled on his boots and went outside.

The raft was moving. It had been moving all night. While Samuel slept, the men had kept working, steering the great mass of logs down the river in the dark. Now the eastern sky was pale with dawn, and the shore on either side was different from yesterday—lower, flatter, the trees smaller and farther apart.

"There's the boy." Hendricks was sitting by a small iron stove that had been set up near the cook's station. "Thought you'd sleep through breakfast."

"What time is it?"

"Time to eat, if you're hungry. Time to work, if you're not."

Samuel ate. The cook was a thin man named Peterson who never seemed to talk. He gave Samuel a plate of salt pork and corn mush and a cup of black coffee. The coffee was bitter and too hot, but Samuel drank it because the other men did.

After breakfast, Hendricks put him to work.

"Water bucket's there. Keep it full from the river. Use the rope—don't lean out too far or you'll fall in and we won't stop to fish you out." He was not joking. Samuel could tell.

The work was simple but endless. The men at the sweeps called for water every few minutes. They sweated even in the cold April air, straining against the heavy oars. Samuel brought them the bucket and the tin dipper, and they drank without stopping their work, then handed the dipper back and kept pulling.

By midday Samuel's arms ached from hauling the bucket up from the river. The rope burned his palms. He wrapped his hands in strips of cloth, the way he had seen the men wrap theirs, and kept working.

In the afternoon, Uncle Nate called him over.

"Come here. Look."

Samuel climbed up to the pilot's platform. It was a raised section in the middle of the raft, higher than a man's head, where Uncle Nate could see the river ahead. From up here, Samuel could see everything—the long stretch of brown water ahead, the wooded banks on either side, the men working at the sweeps below.

"See that?" Uncle Nate pointed. "That ripple in the water, there. What do you think that is?"

Samuel looked. He saw a faint line across the water, a place where the surface moved differently. "I don't know."

"Sandbar. Just under the surface. Current's pushing over it. You see how the water moves?"

Samuel looked again. Now he could see it—the way the river's surface broke just slightly at that line, the way the current split around it.

"If we hit that, we run aground," Uncle Nate said. "Take us half a day to get loose. Maybe lose some logs. You understand?"

"Yes, sir."

"A raft pilot reads the water. He knows where the sandbars are, where the snags are, where the current runs deep. He knows by looking. You watch long enough, you start to see it."

Uncle Nate turned back to his work. "Bow left!" he shouted. "Steady on the stern!"

The men at the sweeps adjusted their pull, and the raft swung gently away from the rippling water. They passed the sandbar with room to spare.

Samuel watched. He tried to see what Uncle Nate saw—the river as a map, a pattern, something that could be read like a page in a book. He could not see it yet. But he kept watching.

The days took on a rhythm.

Samuel woke before dawn and ate with the crew. He worked the water bucket until his arms burned. He watched the men at the sweeps, memorizing their movements—the way they leaned into the oars, the way they pulled in unison when Uncle Nate called out orders. In the afternoons, when the current ran smooth and easy, some of the men rested, sleeping on the logs or mending their clothes or playing cards in the shade of the wigwams.

Samuel did not rest. He found work. He helped Peterson peel potatoes for supper. He coiled rope. He cleaned the rust off a spare sweep-pin with sand and a rag.

Hendricks noticed. He did not say anything, but he nodded once at Samuel, and after that he stopped calling him "the boy."

"Your name's Samuel?" he asked one evening.

"Yes, sir."

"You work hard, Samuel. That's good. Most boys your age, they complain. They want to rest. You keep working."

"My father said not to complain."

Hendricks laughed. It was a short, rough sound. "Your father sounds like a sensible man."

On the fifth day, Uncle Nate let Samuel touch the sweep.

"Come here," he said. "Hendricks, give the boy your spot."

Hendricks stepped back, and Samuel took his place at the great oar. The sweep was made of pine, polished smooth by hundreds of hands. It was warm from the sun.

"Now pull," Uncle Nate said.

Samuel pulled. The sweep did not move.

"Harder."

He pulled harder. His boots slid on the wet logs. The sweep trembled but barely shifted.

"That's fifty feet of oar and a thousand logs behind it," Uncle Nate said. "You can't move it alone. That's why there's ten men on each sweep. You work together or you don't work at all. Now get back on the bucket."

Samuel went back to carrying water. But he understood something now. The raft was not just wood and rope. It was weight. Impossible, enormous weight, and only the strength of men working together could make it go where it needed to go.

That night he lay in the wigwam and listened to the water beneath the logs. The raft moved on in the dark, carrying him south. He could feel the current through the wood, a steady pulse like a heartbeat.

He thought about his mother's letter, still safe in his coat. He thought about the four dollars. He thought about what Hendricks had said—*you work hard*.

Samuel closed his eyes. His hands hurt and his back ached and his arms felt like they were made of lead. But he was not unhappy. He was doing real work, a man's work, and he was learning.

Tomorrow he would learn more.

The river carried them on.
