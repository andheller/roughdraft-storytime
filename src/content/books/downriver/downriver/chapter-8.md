# St. Louis

They saw St. Louis on a clear May morning, six weeks after leaving Wisconsin.

Samuel stood at the bow and watched the city grow out of the bluffs. It was enormous—bigger than anything he had imagined, bigger than Dubuque and Rock Island and every town they had passed combined. Buildings rose in layers up the hillside, brick and stone and painted wood. Church steeples pierced the sky. Smoke drifted from a hundred chimneys.

And the river was crowded with boats.

Samuel counted twelve steamboats at the wharves, their tall stacks belching black smoke. Flatboats piled with cargo rode low in the water. Smaller craft darted between the larger vessels—rowboats, fishing boats, ferries crossing to the far shore. And rafts. There were other rafts, some as big as their own, tied up along the lumber docks.

"That's it," Hendricks said, standing beside him. "That's where we've been heading."

"It's big."

"Biggest city on the river. Maybe the biggest city in the country, I don't know. Never been anywhere else."

Uncle Nate guided them in. It took nearly an hour to work the raft through the traffic, steering around the steamboats and their churning paddle wheels. By the time they tied up at the lumber wharf, the sun was high overhead.

The buyers were waiting.

Samuel watched Uncle Nate work.

The buyers walked along the edge of the raft, just like in Dubuque, looking at the logs. But there were more of them here, and they asked more questions. How old was the timber? Where was it cut? How long had it been in the water?

Uncle Nate answered everything. He knew the trees by name—white pine, red pine, the occasional oak that had been mixed in. He knew how many board feet each log would yield. He knew the going rate and when to argue and when to stay quiet.

"Fifteen dollars per thousand feet," one buyer offered.

"Eighteen," Uncle Nate said.

"That's too high. I can get Wisconsin pine from three other rafts today."

"Then buy from them." Uncle Nate did not raise his voice. "But their pine isn't as clean as mine. No knots. No rot. Look for yourself."

The buyer looked. He walked down the length of the raft, examining log after log. Finally he came back.

"Seventeen."

"Done."

They shook hands. The buyer called for his crew, and men with long poles and hooks began rolling the logs off the raft, sending them splashing into the water where other men caught them and guided them toward the shore.

Samuel watched the raft shrink. String by string, the logs he had floated with for six weeks were pulled away. By late afternoon, there was nothing left but the platform they stood on—the frame and the wigwams and the place where the cook's stove had been before the storm took it.

"That's it," Uncle Nate said. "We're done."

They settled accounts on the wharf.

The buyer paid in cash—a thick stack of bills that Uncle Nate counted twice before putting in his wallet. Then Uncle Nate turned to the crew.

"Line up. Everyone gets their share."

The men lined up. One by one, they stepped forward, and Uncle Nate counted out their wages. Some got more, some less—it depended on their job, how many runs they'd made, whether they had any debts against their pay.

Garrett was near the front. His arm was still in the sling, and his face was pale, but he stood straight.

"Half wages," Uncle Nate said. "You worked half the trip."

"That's fair," Garrett said. He took the money and walked away without looking back.

Samuel watched him go. Half wages was two dollars. Two dollars for an arm that might never work right again.

"Samuel Corwin."

Samuel stepped forward. Uncle Nate looked at him for a long moment.

"You signed on to carry water. I put you on the sweep instead. You worked the rapids. You worked the storm." Uncle Nate reached into the stack of bills and pulled out four silver dollars. "Full wages."

He put the coins in Samuel's hand.

They were heavy. Samuel had held coins before, but never like this. These were his. He had earned them.

"Thank you," he said.

Uncle Nate nodded. "You did the work. The pay's not thanks—it's what you earned."

---

The crew scattered after that.

Some headed into the city, looking for food or drink or beds in boarding houses. Some had family in St. Louis and went to find them. Some, like Hendricks, would sign on to another raft heading back upriver, making the trip in reverse.

Samuel stood on the empty wharf and looked at the city.

"What now?" he asked.

Uncle Nate was checking his wallet, making sure everything was in order. "Now we go home. Steamboat to Muscatine, then we walk. Should take two weeks, maybe less."

"Two weeks."

"Your mother will be glad to see you." Uncle Nate looked at him. "Your father too."

Samuel thought about the farm. The small house. The field that needed planting, the cow that needed milking. It felt far away, like something from another life.

But it was still home. And he was going back to it.

"When do we leave?"

"Tomorrow morning. First boat north." Uncle Nate put his wallet away. "Tonight, we eat. Real food, cooked on a real stove. And then we sleep in real beds. You've earned that much."

They walked up from the wharf together, into the city. Samuel's four dollars were heavy in his pocket. His hands were calloused, his shoulders were sore, and his boots had holes that let in water.

But he was walking like a man who had done a man's work.

And that was worth more than any four dollars could buy.
