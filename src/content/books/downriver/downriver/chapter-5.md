# The Man Who Fell

The morning after they left Dubuque, the river turned.

Samuel had grown used to the wide, straight stretches where the current ran smooth and easy. Now the Mississippi bent and twisted, curving around islands thick with willows. The water moved faster here, and the men at the sweeps worked harder to keep the raft in the channel.

"Watch the right bank!" Uncle Nate called. "Current's pushing us wide!"

The bow crew leaned into their sweep. The stern crew pulled the opposite way. The raft turned slowly, slowly, the logs groaning against each other.

That was when Garrett fell.

Garrett was one of the younger men, maybe eighteen or nineteen. He worked the stern sweep, and he was good at it—quick on his feet, strong in the arms. Samuel had watched him jump from crib to crib during the snag crisis, sure-footed as a cat.

But the logs were wet that morning. Rain had fallen in the night, and the deck was slick with water. When Garrett stepped back to brace for a pull, his boot slipped.

Samuel saw it happen. Garrett's arms went wide. His face changed—not fear, not yet, just surprise. Then he went down, hard, and his body hit the gap between two logs and kept going.

He went into the river.

"Man overboard! Man overboard!"

The shout went up from three men at once. Samuel was already running. He did not think about what he was doing. He just ran toward the place where Garrett had gone down.

The logs were moving. That was the terrible thing. The raft did not stop. The river pushed it forward, and the gap where Garrett had fallen was sliding away, moving toward the back of the raft.

Samuel reached the edge and looked down. He could see the water churning between the logs—brown and fast, flecked with white foam. He could not see Garrett.

"There!" Someone grabbed Samuel's arm and pointed. "He's under the stern string!"

Garrett had surfaced behind the raft. He was in the water, his head just visible above the chop. One arm was waving. The other was not moving at all.

Hendricks threw a rope. It landed short. He hauled it back, coiled it, threw again. This time it hit the water near Garrett's waving hand.

"Grab it! Grab the rope!"

Garrett grabbed. Hendricks and two other men pulled. Samuel ran to help, wrapping his still-healing hands around the wet hemp.

They hauled Garrett in like a fish. He came up over the edge of the raft gasping, shaking, water streaming from his clothes. His left arm hung at a wrong angle, the elbow bent where no elbow should bend.

"He's hurt," someone said.

"Get him to the cook's station," Uncle Nate ordered. "Peterson—you know how to set a bone?"

"I've done it before."

They laid Garrett on the planks by the stove. His face was white, and he was breathing in short, quick gasps. His broken arm lay across his chest like something dead.

Peterson knelt beside him. He felt along the arm with careful fingers, starting at the shoulder and working down. When he reached the elbow, Garrett cried out.

"It's bad," Peterson said. "Dislocated at the elbow, maybe broken above it too." He looked at Uncle Nate. "I can set it, but he won't work again this trip."

"Do what you have to do."

Peterson turned to Samuel. "Hold his good arm. Hold it tight. Don't let him move."

Samuel knelt and took Garrett's right hand. Garrett's fingers closed around his, squeezing hard.

"Look at me," Samuel said. He did not know why he said it. The words just came. "Don't look at what he's doing. Look at me."

Garrett looked at him. His eyes were wide with pain and fear.

Peterson grabbed Garrett's broken arm with both hands. There was a sound—a wet, grinding pop—and Garrett screamed. His whole body arched off the planks. His grip on Samuel's hand went so tight that Samuel felt the bones grind together.

Then it was over. Garrett collapsed, panting. His arm was straight again, or nearly straight. Peterson was wrapping it with strips of canvas, binding it to a flat piece of wood.

"He'll live," Peterson said. "But that arm needs a real doctor. He's done working."

Garrett rode the rest of the way in the wigwam.

The other men took turns checking on him, bringing him water and food. Samuel helped. He changed the bandages when they got dirty. He sat with Garrett in the afternoons when the work was slow, listening to him talk about his family back in Wisconsin—a mother, two sisters, a farm that never quite made enough.

"Four dollars would have helped," Garrett said one afternoon. His voice was quiet, tired. "That's why I signed on. Four dollars for six weeks' work."

"You'll still get paid," Samuel said. "Won't you?"

Garrett shrugged with his good shoulder. "Maybe. If Nate's fair about it. I didn't finish the work."

Samuel did not know what to say. He thought about his own four dollars, waiting for him in St. Louis. He thought about what would happen if he fell, if his arm broke, if he could not work.

"I'm sorry," he said.

Garrett looked at him. "It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. The logs were wet. I slipped." He closed his eyes. "That's how it happens out here. One wrong step."

After Garrett's fall, Uncle Nate moved Samuel to the stern sweep.

"You're not strong enough to pull full weight," he said. "But you can stand with the crew. You can learn the rhythm. When they pull, you pull. Understand?"

"Yes, sir."

Samuel took his place at the end of the great oar. Hendricks stood beside him, and three other men beyond. The sweep was heavy in his hands, heavier than he remembered from the day Uncle Nate had let him try it.

"Ready?" Hendricks said.

"Ready."

"Pull!"

They pulled together. Samuel felt the resistance—the weight of the logs, the push of the current—and he threw his whole body into the oar. It was not enough. His pull was nothing compared to the men beside him. But it was something.

"Again! Pull!"

They pulled again. The raft shifted, turning slightly in the channel.

"Good!" Uncle Nate called from the pilot's platform. "Hold her steady!"

Samuel held. His arms burned. His hands ached. But he was working the sweep now. He was part of the crew.

That night Hendricks sat with him at supper.

"You did all right today," he said.

"I didn't do much."

"You did what you could." Hendricks chewed his salt pork slowly. "That's all any of us do. You think I can pull as hard as Paulsen? He's got fifty pounds on me. But I pull what I can, and he pulls what he can, and together we move the raft." He looked at Samuel. "That's the whole trick, son. Nobody does it alone."

Samuel nodded. He understood.

From now on, he would pull with the crew.
