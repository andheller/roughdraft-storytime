# Night Storm

The storm came from the west.

Samuel saw it building all afternoon—a dark line on the horizon, growing taller as the hours passed. The clouds were the color of bruises, purple and green and gray. Lightning flickered in the distance, too far away to hear.

"We should tie up," Hendricks said, looking at the sky. "Find a bank and wait it out."

Uncle Nate shook his head. "No good banks through here. Bluffs on both sides, and the current runs too fast. We'd get pinned against the rocks."

"So we ride it out?"

"We ride it out."

They passed Quincy in the late afternoon. Samuel saw the town lights come on as the darkness spread across the sky. Part of him wished they would stop there, tie up at a safe dock, wait in a warm building until the storm passed.

But the raft kept moving. The river carried them south, and the storm came to meet them.

It hit just after sunset.

The wind arrived first—a hard gust that snapped the canvas of the wigwams and nearly knocked Samuel off his feet. Then the rain came, not in drops but in sheets, so thick he could barely see the bow of the raft from where he stood.

"All hands to the sweeps! Hold her steady!"

Samuel ran to his place. The sweep was slick with rain, hard to grip. He wrapped his arms around it and held on.

The river had changed. It was no longer brown and smooth. It was black and wild, churned up by the wind, waves rising and crashing over the logs. The raft pitched and rolled. Samuel felt his stomach lurch.

Lightning split the sky, so bright it left spots in his eyes. The thunder came half a second later, a crack that shook the air and rattled his teeth.

"Pull! Pull and hold!"

They pulled. The sweep fought them, jerking in their hands as the waves hit. Samuel's feet slid on the wet logs. He dug in with his heels and kept pulling.

Another flash of lightning. In its light Samuel saw the river ahead—a chaos of white-capped waves, the shore invisible in the rain. They were in the middle of nowhere, alone on the water, with nothing to do but hold on.

"We're drifting left! Bow crew, pull hard! Hard!"

The bow crew strained against their sweep. The raft turned, slowly, fighting the wind. Samuel could feel the logs grinding against each other, the lashings creaking.

A wave broke over the deck. Cold water hit Samuel's chest, nearly lifting him off his feet. He gasped, choked, kept holding the sweep.

"Don't let go!" Hendricks shouted in his ear. "Whatever you do, don't let go!"

Samuel did not let go. His hands were numb. His arms were shaking. The sweep was the only solid thing in a world of wind and water and noise.

The storm went on.

---

Hours passed. Or maybe it was minutes. Samuel could not tell. Time had stopped meaning anything. There was only the next wave, the next gust of wind, the next flash of lightning that showed the world in frozen white.

At some point he realized he was crying. The tears mixed with the rain on his face. He did not stop working.

The wigwam next to him tore loose. He saw it happen—the canvas ripping free of its ropes, flying up into the dark like a ghost. It was there and then it was gone, swallowed by the storm.

"Let it go! Stay on the sweep!"

Samuel stayed. The raft bucked beneath him. A crib somewhere behind them was taking on water, the logs riding lower than they should. Men were shouting, but he could not hear the words over the wind.

And then, slowly, the storm began to pass.

The rain eased. The wind dropped. The lightning moved east, the flashes growing fainter, the thunder fading to a distant rumble.

Samuel stood at the sweep, blinking. His whole body ached. He could not feel his hands.

The sky was gray now, not black. He could see the shore—a dark line of trees on either side of the river. They were still in the channel. They had not run aground.

"Easy on the sweeps," Uncle Nate called. His voice was hoarse, tired. "Let her ride. We're through."

The dawn came gray and cold.

Samuel sat on a crib near the bow, wrapped in a wet blanket. He was too tired to sleep. Too tired to move. He just sat there, watching the light grow in the east.

They had lost one wigwam and half their supplies. The cook's stove had gone over the side in the night, and Peterson was already talking about how they would manage without it. Cold food for the rest of the trip. No hot coffee.

But the raft was whole. The lashings had held. No one had fallen overboard.

Uncle Nate came and sat beside him. He did not say anything for a long time. They watched the sun rise together, a pale disk behind the clouds.

Then Uncle Nate put his hand on Samuel's shoulder.

He did not squeeze. He did not pat. He just rested his hand there, heavy and warm, and left it for a moment.

Then he stood up and walked back to the pilot's platform.

Samuel understood. That was the thing about Uncle Nate—he did not use words when he did not need them. The hand on the shoulder said everything.

*You did well.*

*I'm proud of you.*

*You belong here.*

Samuel pulled the wet blanket tighter around his shoulders and watched the river unfold ahead. St. Louis was close now. A few more days. A week at most.

The worst was behind them.

The river carried them on.
