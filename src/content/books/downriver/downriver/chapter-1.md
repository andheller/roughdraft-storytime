# The Last Pine

The last pine came down on a Tuesday morning in April. Samuel watched it fall. The tree was taller than any building he had ever seen, and when it hit the frozen ground the impact shook through his boots and up into his chest.

"That's the end of it," his father said. "Camp's done."

All winter the logging crews had worked these woods, felling the great white pines and dragging them to the riverbank with teams of oxen. Now the hillsides stood bare and strange, nothing but stumps and slash where the forest had been. The logs lay stacked along the Chippewa River in long rows, waiting for the ice to break.

Samuel was eleven years old. He had spent the winter helping his mother cook for the camp—peeling potatoes, hauling water, scrubbing pots in the cold. His father worked as a sawyer, one of the two-man teams that brought down the trees. The pay was good. By spring they would have enough money to buy seed for planting and maybe a new milk cow.

But now the work was finished, and Samuel's father would go back to the farm. Samuel would not.

"You sure about this?" his father asked.

Samuel nodded. He was not sure. He had never been sure about anything less in his life. But he said, "Yes, sir."

His father looked at him for a long moment. Then he held out his hand. Samuel took it. His father's grip was hard and rough from the saw, and he shook Samuel's hand the way he would shake another man's.

"You do what your uncle tells you," his father said. "You work hard and you don't complain. You understand?"

"Yes, sir."

"Four dollars is good wages. You bring that money home."

"I will."

His mother was waiting by the cook shanty. She had a letter in her hand, already sealed and addressed. "Mail this from Dubuque," she said. "It's for your Aunt Ruth. Tell her we're well."

Samuel put the letter inside his coat, close to his chest where it would stay dry. His mother's eyes were red but she was not crying. She kissed his forehead and held his face between her hands.

"You're a good boy," she said. "You'll do fine."

Samuel wanted to say something, but his throat felt tight and strange. He just nodded.

His uncle was down by the river, watching the men build the raft.

Uncle Nate was his father's older brother. He was a raft pilot, which meant he knew the river from the Chippewa all the way down to St. Louis. He had made the trip nine times. He was a quiet man with a brown beard and eyes that seemed to be always looking at something far away.

"There you are," Uncle Nate said when Samuel walked up. "Put your things in the wigwam. Second one from the front. Don't touch anything that isn't yours."

That was all. No greeting, no welcome. Samuel picked up his bundle—one change of clothes, a tin cup, and the pocketknife his father had given him for his birthday—and walked out onto the raft.

It was the strangest thing he had ever stood on. The raft was made of logs, hundreds of them, lashed together with rope and pinned with wooden pegs. The logs floated on the river, and the whole structure moved gently with the current, rocking like something alive.

Samuel counted the sections as he walked. The men called them cribs. Each crib was about sixteen feet wide and thirty feet long, a little bigger than the cabin where he had been born. The cribs were fastened together in long rows called strings, and the strings were lashed side by side to make the raft.

He counted twelve strings. The raft was bigger than a barn. Bigger than a church. It was the largest thing Samuel had ever seen that could move.

The wigwams were canvas tents set up on wooden platforms in the middle of the raft. Samuel found the second one and ducked inside. It was small and dark and smelled of pine pitch and old smoke. Three bedrolls were already laid out on the plank floor. He put his bundle in the corner and went back outside.

The men were still working. At the front and back of the raft, crews were mounting the sweeps—huge oars, longer than the raft was wide, fixed to wooden posts so they could swing back and forth. It took four men to lift each sweep into place.

"You ever worked a sweep before?"

Samuel turned. A man was watching him, a big man with a red face and arms like tree trunks. He wore no coat despite the cold.

"No, sir."

"Didn't think so. You're Nate's nephew?"

"Yes, sir."

"I'm Hendricks. I work the bow. You stay out of my way, you might learn something." He looked Samuel up and down. "You know how to carry water?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good. That's your job. You keep the water bucket full. When a man calls for water, you bring it. You don't spill it. Understand?"

Samuel understood. He had carried water all his life.

The work went on through the afternoon. Samuel stayed out of the way and watched. He counted twenty-two men, not including himself and Uncle Nate. Some were young, barely older than Samuel. Some were old, with gray beards and bent backs. They all worked without talking much, moving with the ease of men who had done this many times before.

By evening the raft was ready.

They pushed off at dawn.

Samuel stood near the front and watched the riverbank slide away. His parents were there, small figures growing smaller. His father raised one hand. His mother did not wave. She just stood there, watching, until the river bent and the trees came between them.

The raft moved without sound. That was the strange thing. Samuel had expected noise—creaking wood, splashing water, something. But there was only the soft push of current against the logs and the distant calls of the men at the sweeps.

"Hold her steady!" That was Uncle Nate, standing on a platform in the middle of the raft where he could see the whole river ahead. "Current's taking us. Let her ride!"

The men at the sweeps leaned on the long oars, keeping the raft pointed downstream. The river was wide and brown with snowmelt, swollen with the spring thaw. On either bank the trees were just beginning to bud, pale green against the gray sky.

Samuel found a place to sit where he was not in anyone's way. He watched the shore go by. He thought about his mother's letter, safe inside his coat. He thought about the four dollars he would earn if they made it to St. Louis.

Six weeks, Uncle Nate had said. Maybe seven, depending on the river.

Six weeks of this. Six weeks of water and work and sleeping on a pile of logs in the middle of the Mississippi River.

Samuel took a deep breath. The air smelled like pine and cold water and something else—something he had no name for. The smell of going somewhere. The smell of a journey begun.

The raft floated on, and the river carried them south.
