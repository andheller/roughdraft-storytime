# The Walk Home

The steamboat carried them north for three days.

Samuel stood at the rail and watched the river unwind beneath them. The boat moved fast, faster than the raft had ever moved—pushed by great paddle wheels that churned the brown water white. Towns slid past. Bluffs rose and fell. The same miles that had taken him six weeks to travel downriver now vanished in hours.

It felt wrong, somehow. Too fast. Too easy.

At Muscatine they left the steamboat. Uncle Nate paid for passage as far as the money would take them, but it would not take them all the way home. The last hundred miles they would walk.

"Ready?" Uncle Nate asked.

Samuel shouldered his bundle—still just one change of clothes, a tin cup, and his pocketknife, the same as when he left. The clothes were worn now, patched in places. The cup was dented. The knife had been sharpened so many times that the blade was half as wide as it had been in April.

"Ready," he said.

They walked.

---

The road wound through farmland and forest, following the river valleys north and west. They slept in barns when farmers let them, and under trees when they did not. Uncle Nate knew the way. He had walked this road nine times before.

They did not talk much. There was no need. After six weeks on the raft, they had grown used to each other's silence.

But on the fourth night, sitting by a small fire in a clearing, Uncle Nate spoke.

"You did well."

Samuel looked at him. The firelight made deep shadows on Uncle Nate's face.

"Thank you."

"I wasn't sure about bringing you. You're young. It's hard work. Most boys your age, they can't handle it." Uncle Nate poked at the fire with a stick. "But your father said you were ready. He was right."

Samuel thought about his father. The handshake before he left. *You do what your uncle tells you. You don't complain.*

"Will you take another raft down next year?" Samuel asked.

"Probably. The timber's getting thin up on the Chippewa, but there's still enough for a few more years. After that, I don't know. Maybe the railroads will take over." Uncle Nate shrugged. "Things change. The river stays the same, but everything else changes."

They sat in silence for a while. The fire crackled. Somewhere in the dark, an owl called.

"Could I come with you?" Samuel asked. "Next year, I mean."

Uncle Nate looked at him. His eyes were steady, unreadable.

"Ask your father," he said. "If he says yes, there's a place for you."

That was all. But it was enough.

They reached the farm on a warm evening in late May.

Samuel saw it from the top of the last hill—the small house, the barn, the field where his father would be planting corn by now. Smoke rose from the chimney. A cow stood in the pasture, flicking its tail at flies.

He stopped. Uncle Nate stopped beside him.

"There it is," Uncle Nate said. "Home."

Samuel did not move. He was not sure why. He had thought about this moment for six weeks, imagined walking up the path to the door, seeing his mother's face. But now that it was here, he felt strange. Nervous. Like he was a different person than the boy who had left.

"Go on," Uncle Nate said. "They're waiting."

Samuel walked down the hill.

His mother saw him first. She came out of the house and stood on the porch, her hand raised to shade her eyes. For a moment she did not move. Then she was running toward him, her skirt flying behind her, and she caught him in her arms and held him tight.

"You're home," she said. "You're home, you're home."

Samuel hugged her back. She smelled like bread and woodsmoke and soap. She smelled like home.

His father came out of the barn, walking slowly. He stopped a few feet away and looked at Samuel—looked at the calluses on his hands, the sunburn on his face, the way he stood.

"You made it," his father said.

"Yes, sir."

"Nate says you did good."

"I tried."

His father nodded slowly. Then he held out his hand, the same way he had when Samuel left.

Samuel shook it.

That night, after supper, Samuel sat on the porch and looked at the stars.

The four silver dollars were in his pocket. He had shown them to his mother, and she had cried. He had given them to his father, who had put them in the tin box under the bed where they kept their savings. Four dollars. Enough for seed, maybe. Enough to help.

But that was not what Samuel thought about.

He thought about the river. The sound of water moving under the logs. The weight of the sweep in his hands. The way the current felt when he stood at the edge of the raft and looked south, toward places he had never been.

He thought about Hendricks, and Peterson, and Garrett with his broken arm. He thought about Captain Rambo, steering them through the rapids. He thought about Uncle Nate's hand on his shoulder after the storm.

He was home. But part of him was still out there, floating on the brown water, watching the shore slide by.

The river had changed him. He knew that now. He was not the same boy who had said goodbye to his parents in April. He was someone new. Someone who had done real work, faced real danger, and come through.

Next year, maybe, he would do it again.

But for now, he was home. And home was good.

Samuel went inside. His mother had made up his bed with clean sheets, and his pillow smelled like lavender from the drawer where she kept it.

He lay down. He closed his eyes.

And he dreamed of the river.
