# Dubuque

They saw Dubuque from five miles upriver.

The city rose on bluffs above the water, white buildings and church steeples catching the afternoon sun. Smoke drifted from chimneys. Samuel could see boats tied up along the waterfront—steamboats with their tall stacks, flatboats piled with cargo, and other rafts like their own, some even bigger.

"We'll stop here overnight," Uncle Nate said. "Sell off two strings. Take on supplies."

The men cheered. Samuel understood why. Two weeks on the river, sleeping on logs, eating the same food every day. A night in town meant solid ground. It meant hot food cooked by someone else. For some of the men, it meant other things—Samuel had heard them talking about taverns and card games—but he did not care about any of that.

He just wanted to mail his mother's letter.

They tied up at the lumber wharf in the late afternoon. Buyers were waiting—men in good coats with paper and pencils, walking along the edge of the raft, looking at the logs.

"Good pine," Samuel heard one of them say. "Clean grain. How much for the lot?"

"We're not selling the lot," Uncle Nate said. "Two strings. That's what I can spare."

They haggled. Samuel watched. Uncle Nate's face never changed, but his voice got quieter and slower the longer they talked. Finally the buyer nodded and pulled out a leather wallet. He counted bills into Uncle Nate's hand.

"Pleasure doing business," the buyer said.

"Likewise."

The buyer walked away. Uncle Nate counted the money again, folded it, and put it inside his coat.

"Paulsen, Hendricks—unlash the two stern strings. The rest of you, you've got until dawn. Don't get arrested."

The men scattered. Some headed up the bluff toward town. Others stayed on the raft, sleeping or mending clothes. Samuel stood at the edge of the wharf, looking at the city.

"You going up?" Hendricks asked.

"Yes, sir. I have a letter to mail."

"Post office is on Main Street. Turn left at the top of the hill, keep walking. You can't miss it." Hendricks looked at him. "You have money?"

Samuel shook his head.

Hendricks reached into his pocket and pulled out a coin. "Two cents for the postage. Get yourself a bun at the bakery next door. You look hungry."

"I can't take your money."

"You can pay me back out of your wages in St. Louis." Hendricks pressed the coin into Samuel's bandaged hand. "Go on. Be back by dark."

Walking on solid ground felt wrong.

Samuel's legs had grown used to the constant movement of the raft, the gentle rocking of the logs beneath his feet. Now the street was hard and still, and his body kept expecting it to shift. He stumbled twice on the way up the hill.

Dubuque was the biggest town Samuel had ever seen. There were buildings three and four stories tall, built of brick and stone. There were shops with glass windows and signs painted in gold letters. There were people everywhere—men in suits, women in long dresses, children running and shouting. A wagon rattled past, pulled by two gray horses. A dog barked from an alley.

The sounds were too loud. The smells were too strong. After two weeks of pine and river water, the city seemed to press in from every side.

Samuel found the post office. It was a small building with a flag out front. Inside, a man sat behind a counter, sorting letters into wooden boxes.

"Help you?"

Samuel pulled the letter from inside his coat. It was creased and soft from being carried so long, but the ink was still clear. "I need to mail this. To Wisconsin."

The man looked at the address. "Three cents."

"I only have two."

The man studied Samuel for a moment—his rough clothes, his bandaged hands, the sunburn on his face. "Where you coming from?"

"The Chippewa. I'm on a raft, going to St. Louis."

"Raftsman, huh?" The man almost smiled. "Two cents is fine. We'll call it a discount for the working man."

He took the letter and put it in one of the boxes. Samuel watched it go. In a week, maybe less, his mother would hold that letter in her hands. She would know he was safe. She would know he had made it this far.

"Thank you," Samuel said.

"Safe travels, son."

The bakery was next door, just like Hendricks had said. Samuel bought a sweet bun with the penny he had left. He ate it standing on the sidewalk, watching the people go by.

A boy about his age walked past with a fishing pole over his shoulder. Two girls in matching blue dresses skipped by, laughing at some joke. A man pushed a cart loaded with apples, calling out his prices in a loud, singing voice.

They all looked so clean. So rested. Their hands were not bandaged. Their clothes were not stiff with river water and pine pitch.

Samuel finished his bun and walked back down the hill toward the wharf.

The raft looked smaller tied up at the dock. In the middle of the river it had seemed enormous, a whole world floating on the water. Here, next to the steamboats and the brick warehouses, it was just a pile of logs held together with rope.

But it was home now. Samuel realized that as he stepped back onto the deck. The slight give of the logs beneath his feet, the smell of wood and water, the sound of the river moving past—it all felt right in a way that the city streets had not.

Hendricks was sitting by the cook's stove, cleaning his boots.

"Mail your letter?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good." Hendricks looked up. "How was the town?"

Samuel thought about it. The noise. The crowds. The boy with the fishing pole.

"Too still," he said.

Hendricks laughed. "That's what they all say. First time in town after a week on the river, it feels like the ground's broken. Like something's missing."

"What's missing?"

"The current." Hendricks went back to cleaning his boots. "Out here, we're always moving. Even when we're standing still, the river's carrying us. Town doesn't move. That's why it feels wrong."

Samuel nodded. He understood.

That night he slept better than he had since they left Wisconsin. The raft rocked gently against the dock, and the river whispered beneath the logs, and in his dreams he was still moving, still going south, still on his way.
