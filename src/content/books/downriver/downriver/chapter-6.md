# Rock Island Rapids

They heard the rapids before they saw them.

Samuel was at his place on the stern sweep when the sound reached him—a low, steady roar, like wind through pines but deeper. He looked at Hendricks.

"Rapids," Hendricks said. "Rock Island. Fifteen miles of bad water."

Samuel had heard the men talk about the rapids. They spoke of them the way his father spoke about winter storms—with respect and a little fear. Even experienced pilots lost rafts here. Logs broke loose. Men drowned.

"We'll need a guide," Uncle Nate said. "There's a town up ahead. LeClaire. The rapids pilots live there."

They tied up at LeClaire that afternoon. It was a small town, smaller than Dubuque, built on a flat stretch of riverbank just above the rough water. Samuel could see the rapids from the wharf—a stretch of white and brown where the river broke over rocks, churning and foaming for as far as he could see.

Uncle Nate went into town alone. He came back an hour later with a man Samuel had never seen before.

"This is Captain Rambo," Uncle Nate said. "He'll take us through."

Captain Rambo was an old man, maybe sixty, with a white beard and eyes that looked like they had seen everything the river could do and were not impressed. He walked across the raft without hurrying, studying the logs, testing the lashings.

"Good raft," he said finally. "Well made. Who built it?"

"Camp foreman named Bjornson," Uncle Nate said. "Up on the Chippewa."

"He knows his business." Captain Rambo squinted at the rapids ahead. "We'll go at first light. The morning current runs cleaner. I want every man at the sweeps. No exceptions."

He looked at Samuel.

"You too, boy. You'll work or you'll stay here. Your choice."

"I'll work," Samuel said.

"Good." Captain Rambo almost smiled. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow will be long."

They pushed off at dawn.

The river was silver in the early light, the air cold and still. Captain Rambo stood on the pilot's platform beside Uncle Nate, but there was no question who was in charge now. When Captain Rambo spoke, Uncle Nate listened.

"Easy on the bow! Let the current take us!"

The sweeps went still. The raft drifted forward, picking up speed as it approached the white water.

Samuel could feel the change beneath his feet. The logs began to move differently—not the gentle rocking he was used to, but a harder, more urgent motion. The raft was no longer floating. It was being pulled.

"Hard left! Now!"

The bow crew threw their weight against the sweep. Samuel pulled with the stern crew, every muscle straining. The raft turned, barely, slipping past a dark shape in the water—a boulder, just under the surface.

"Hold! Hold steady!"

They held. The current grabbed the raft and yanked it forward. Samuel saw white water explode around the edges of the logs. Spray hit his face, cold as ice.

"Right! Hard right!"

They pulled the other way. The raft swung. Another rock slid past, so close that Samuel could have touched it.

And then they were in the middle of the rapids.

The noise was everywhere. Samuel could not hear the orders anymore—only the roar of water over stone, the crash of the current against the logs. He watched Hendricks and pulled when Hendricks pulled, held when Hendricks held. The sweep bucked in his hands like a living thing.

The raft bucked and shuddered. Water washed over the deck. Samuel's boots were soaked. His grip on the sweep was slipping. He wrapped his arms around the oar and held on with his whole body.

A log broke loose. Samuel saw it go—a single pine, spinning away into the white water. It hit a rock and shattered, splinters flying. Gone.

"Keep pulling! Don't stop!"

They did not stop. Samuel's arms screamed. His shoulders burned. The world was nothing but water and noise and the desperate pull of the sweep.

And then, suddenly, it was over.

The raft shot out of the rapids into calm water. The roar faded behind them. The river stretched ahead, smooth and brown and quiet.

Samuel collapsed against the sweep, gasping. His whole body was shaking.

Around him, the men were cheering. Hendricks was laughing, slapping Paulsen on the back. Even Peterson was smiling. They had made it. They were through.

Captain Rambo climbed down from the pilot's platform. He walked to the edge of the raft and looked back at the rapids, now just a distant white line across the river.

"Good work," he said. "One log lost. Could have been worse. Could have been a lot worse."

He turned and shook Uncle Nate's hand. "You've got a good crew. That boy included." He nodded at Samuel. "He didn't let go."

"No," Uncle Nate said. "He didn't."

They dropped Captain Rambo at Rock Island, the town that gave the rapids their name. Uncle Nate paid him in coins from the leather wallet, and the old man walked off down the dock without looking back.

Samuel stood at the edge of the raft and watched the rapids grow smaller in the distance. In a few hours they would be gone from sight. In a few days he would not be able to hear them anymore.

But he would never forget them.

"First time through?" Hendricks stood beside him, looking back at the white water.

"Yes, sir."

"How did it feel?"

Samuel thought about it. The fear. The noise. The moment when his grip started to slip and he thought he was going to fall.

"I thought we were going to die," he said.

Hendricks nodded. "We all think that, first time through. Second time too. Third time, you start to realize that thinking you're going to die and actually dying are two different things." He clapped Samuel on the shoulder. "You did good. Now get some rest. The river runs smooth for a while."

Samuel found a dry spot on the logs and sat down. The sun was warm on his face. The raft rocked gently on the calm water.

He was not the same boy who had left Wisconsin. He could feel the difference. Something had changed—not just his body, with its new calluses and aching muscles, but something inside.

He had been afraid, and he had kept working.

He had felt his grip slipping, and he had held on.

That was something. That meant something.

Samuel closed his eyes and let the sun dry his clothes. The river carried them south.
