# The Snag

It happened on the eighth day, an hour before sunset.

Samuel was bringing water to the stern crew when he heard Uncle Nate shout. It was not the normal call for the sweeps. It was something else—sharp, high, almost like the sound a man makes when he is hurt.

"Hard left! Hard left! Snag ahead!"

The men at the bow sweeps threw their weight against the oars. The great beams swung wide. But the raft was too heavy, too slow. Samuel felt the current pulling them sideways. He saw the water ahead break and foam around something dark just below the surface.

The raft hit the snag.

The impact was not loud. That was the strange thing. Samuel had expected a crash, a boom, something that matched the size of what was happening. Instead there was only a deep, grinding crunch—the sound of wood meeting wood underwater—and then the whole raft shuddered.

Samuel lost his footing. The water bucket flew from his hands and rolled across the logs. He fell hard on his side, the breath knocked out of him.

"Check the lashings! Check the lashings now!"

Men were running. Samuel pushed himself up and saw Hendricks sprinting toward the starboard side, where the raft's edge met the river. Other men followed. Samuel got to his feet and ran after them.

The snag had caught them on the right side, near the back. It was a dead tree, a great pine that must have fallen into the river upstream and floated down until it lodged in the riverbed. The top of the trunk still showed above the water, white and bare, stripped of bark. The roots were underwater, invisible, and they had torn into the raft like claws.

"We're losing the seventh string!" someone shouted.

Samuel could see it now. The seventh string—twelve cribs lashed together in a long row—had broken loose. The rope that held it to the rest of the raft had snapped. The string was drifting away, pulled by the current, spinning slowly as it went.

"Get the rope! Get the rope!"

Hendricks grabbed a coil of hemp rope and threw one end toward the drifting string. The rope uncoiled in the air, spinning out over the brown water. It fell short. The string kept drifting.

A young man—his name was Paulsen—ran to the edge of the raft and jumped. He hit the water and went under, then came up gasping. He swam hard toward the loose string, fighting the current.

"Throw him the line! Throw him the line!"

Hendricks threw again. This time the rope reached Paulsen. He caught it with one hand and kept swimming with the other. When he reached the loose string he pulled himself up onto the logs, wrapped the rope around a peg, and held on.

"Pull! All hands pull!"

Samuel grabbed the rope. So did everyone else. Twenty men hauled on the line, leaning back, digging their heels into the logs. The loose string fought them. The current pulled at it. The rope creaked and groaned.

Slowly, foot by foot, they pulled the string back.

It took an hour. Samuel's hands burned. The rope tore at his palms, wearing through the cloth he had wrapped around them. Blood seeped into the fibers. He did not let go.

When the string was finally close enough to lash back to the raft, Hendricks and two other men jumped across to secure it. They worked fast, tying new knots, driving new pegs. The sun was setting by the time they finished, the sky going red and gold in the west.

Uncle Nate called a halt for the night.

They poled the raft toward the shore and tied it to trees on the bank. No one had ever done that before—every other night they had kept moving, steering through the dark. But the snag had damaged the lashings in three places, and they needed time to make repairs.

Samuel sat on a crib near the edge of the raft and looked at his hands. The cloth wrappings were soaked with blood. His palms were raw, the skin torn away in strips.

"Let me see."

Peterson, the cook, crouched beside him. He took Samuel's hands and turned them over, studying the damage in the fading light.

"Not too bad," he said. "I've seen worse."

"It hurts."

"It will hurt more tomorrow." Peterson unwrapped the bloody cloth and threw it into the river. He pulled a small tin from his pocket and opened it. Inside was a thick yellow grease that smelled like pine tar and something else, something sharp. "Hold still."

He smeared the grease across Samuel's palms. It stung fiercely, worse than the rope burn, and Samuel clenched his jaw to keep from crying out.

"That's good," Peterson said. "Means it's working. Keep your hands clean tonight. No water work tomorrow. Understand?"

"Yes, sir."

Peterson wrapped Samuel's hands in fresh cloth and stood up. "You did good," he said. "Most boys would have let go."

He walked away before Samuel could answer.

That night they ate cold food. Peterson did not light the stove. The men sat in small groups, talking quietly, chewing on hard biscuit and dried beef. Some of them looked at the place where the snag had hit, the broken ropes and splintered wood still visible in the moonlight.

Uncle Nate came and sat beside Samuel.

"How are your hands?"

"They hurt."

"They'll hurt for a while." Uncle Nate was quiet for a moment. "You held the rope. I saw you."

Samuel did not know what to say. He had held the rope because everyone else was holding it. There had been nothing else to do.

"Some men let go," Uncle Nate said. "When it hurts, when it gets hard, they let go. They think someone else will hold on for them." He looked at Samuel in the dark. "You didn't let go."

"No, sir."

"That's what matters. Out here, that's the only thing that matters." Uncle Nate stood up. "Get some sleep. We push off at first light."

Samuel lay in the wigwam and listened to the river. His hands throbbed. When he closed his eyes, he saw the loose string drifting away, spinning in the current. He saw Paulsen jumping into the water. He felt the rope burning through his palms.

But they had not lost the string. Twenty men pulling together had brought it back.

Samuel flexed his bandaged hands. The pain was sharp and clean, and underneath it was something else—something that felt almost like pride.

He slept.
