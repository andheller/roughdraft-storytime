# Chapter 3: A Nutty Problem

The three friends sat in their tree, looking at their small pile of acorns. Six acorns shared between three squirrels for the whole winter? That definitely wasn't enough!

"Maybe we should ask the other squirrels for help," suggested Nutkin.

"But what if they don't have enough either?" worried Acorna.

"What if we learn to eat something else?" wondered Chippy. "Maybe pizza! I've seen the humans eating it, and it smells delicious!"

Just then, they heard a commotion from the nearby maple tree. It was the Chatterton family - a family of squirrels known for being very organized and always prepared.

"Excuse me, Mrs. Chatterton!" called out Nutkin. "We're having trouble finding acorns. Do you know where they all went?"

Mrs. Chatterton looked down at them with kind eyes. "Oh dear, didn't you hear? The park workers removed many of the acorn trees last month to plant new flowers. Most of us have been gathering acorns from the forest beyond the park."

"The forest beyond the park?" The three friends had never been that far from home.

"It's quite a journey," explained Mrs. Chatterton. "Too far for just one squirrel to carry enough acorns back. That's why we work together - some squirrels gather, others carry, and some help store them safely."

The friends looked at each other. They had always done everything separately, each trying to solve problems on their own.

"But we've never worked together like that," admitted Acorna.

"Well," smiled Mrs. Chatterton, "there's a first time for everything!"
