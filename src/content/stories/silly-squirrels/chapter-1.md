# Chapter 1: Meet the Squirrels

In the heart of Nutville, three very silly squirrels lived in the biggest oak tree. Their names were Mama Nutty, Papa Nutty, and Baby Nutty.

Baby Nutty was the smallest but had the biggest dreams. He loved to collect shiny bottle caps and pretend they were treasure.

Mama Nutty was the fastest squirrel in all of Nutville. She could leap from branch to branch so quickly that sometimes she looked like a fuzzy blur!

Papa Nutty was the funniest of the three. He loved to tell jokes and make his family laugh until their bellies hurt.

Every morning, the three family members would meet at the very top of their oak tree to plan their daily adventures.

"What shall we do today?" asked Baby Nutty, polishing his favorite bottle cap.

"Let's race to the pond!" suggested Mama Nutty, already bouncing with excitement.

"Or we could play hide-and-seek with the raccoons!" giggled Papa Nutty.

But today would be different. Today, they would discover something that would change their friendship forever.
