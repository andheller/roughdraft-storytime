# Chapter 1: Meet the Squirrels

In the heart of Oakwood Park, three very silly squirrels lived in the biggest oak tree. Their names were Nutkin, Acorna, and Chippy.

Nutkin was the smallest but had the biggest dreams. He loved to collect shiny bottle caps and pretend they were treasure.

Acorna was the fastest squirrel in the whole park. She could leap from branch to branch so quickly that sometimes she looked like a fuzzy blur!

Chippy was the funniest of the three. He loved to tell jokes and make his friends laugh until their bellies hurt.

Every morning, the three friends would meet at the very top of their oak tree to plan their daily adventures.

"What shall we do today?" asked Nutkin, polishing his favorite bottle cap.

"Let's race to the pond!" suggested Acorna, already bouncing with excitement.

"Or we could play hide-and-seek with the raccoons!" giggled Chippy.

But today would be different. Today, they would discover something that would change their friendship forever.
