# Chapter 4: Working Together

The next morning, Nutkin, Acorna, and Chippy met at the top of their tree with a new plan.

"Okay," said Nutkin, "I've been thinking. Acorna, you're the fastest, so you could scout ahead and find the best acorn spots."

"And Chippy," added Acorna, "you're the funniest, which means you're great at making friends. Maybe you could ask the forest animals for help and directions."

"What about you, Nutkin?" asked Chippy.

"Well, I'm good at organizing things," said Nutkin proudly. "I can keep track of where we've been and where we need to go next."

And so, the three friends set off on their biggest adventure yet. They traveled beyond the park, into the forest where tall trees created a canopy of green above them.

Acorna raced ahead and found a grove of oak trees heavy with acorns. Chippy made friends with a helpful rabbit who showed them the safest paths. Nutkin kept track of their route and made sure they didn't get lost.

Working together, they gathered more acorns in one day than they had ever collected individually. But the best part wasn't the acorns - it was how much fun they had doing it together.

"You know what?" said Chippy as they headed home, their cheeks stuffed with acorns. "This is way more fun than doing everything alone."

"And we got so much more done!" agreed Acorna.

"Plus, we discovered that we each have special talents that help the group," added Nutkin.

From that day on, the three silly squirrels became the best teamwork trio in all of Oakwood Park. They helped other animals solve problems, organized park clean-up days, and even started a weekly story-telling circle where Chippy's jokes were always the highlight.

And every winter, they had more than enough acorns - not just for themselves, but to share with any animal in need.
